**The Data Science Biocultural Diversity Action (DSBD) Framework: Reenvisioning Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs for Data Science and Biocultural Diversity Efforts**

*Novel diagnosis and prescriptive frameworks for assessing oneself and surroundings and exploring the prescriptions of various modern data science tools towards amelioration.*

## Hypothesis: 
"Maslow's hierarchy of needs can be applied to fields outside of the business domain. This will be an exploration of this structure's applicability to the field of data science. It is believed that the application of Maslow's hierarchy of needs to data science studies, will intrinsically support the digital humanities and biocultural diversity efforts. 
The independent and dependent variables would include the various levels of Maslow's hierarchy of needs and the various skills associated with data science.

Due to the increasing amounts of data being globally generated daily, there is an increasing demand for exploration and quantitative backing of matters that were previously unquantifiable. For example, while some recognize the importance of conservation and cultural activities in society, quantifiable support is often lacking; a vicious cycle is created when funding for exploration of these matters is reduced or denied due to lack of quantifiable evidence of its relevance.

Data science is still a growing field, but its existence can be recognized as providing support to various areas of academia. The studies of humanities and biocultural diversity are not often associated with data science as these matters are often viewed as more physically intensive skill-based areas. However, digital humanities and biocultural diversity studies are academic areas that attempt to investigate these areas to add quantifiable research to their importance. 

Ecological and cultural fields of study are now inextricably linked to a modern society were data science exists; therefore by only studying them separately, we fail to gain the full picture of our reality and deny ourselves the future opportunities. As with Venn diagrams, unique and important points of value can be realized by understanding the areas of overlap and interaction. Therefore, exploring data science under a conservation-focused lens my provide some useful insight for all associated fields.
