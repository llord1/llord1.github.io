### Brief Introduction: 

Due to the growing amounts of data being globally generated daily, there is an increasing demand for exploration and quantitative backing of matters that were previously unquantifiable.  For example, while some recognize the importance of conservation and cultural activities in society, quantifiable support is often lacking. A vicious cycle is created when the funding for the exploration of these matters is reduced or denied, due to a scarcity of quantifiable evidence that supports its relevance.

Data science is a growing field, and its existence can be recognized as providing support to various areas of academia. The links between data science and the studies of humanities and biocultural diversity is rarely recognized; the latter topics are more likely to be associated with more physically demanding skills or physical end products rather than digital research. However, consideration of digital humanities and biocultural diversity studies boost one's ability to create and generate academic paradigms as they are already cross investigate various areas to add quantifiable research to their importance. Ecological and cultural fields of study are now inextricably linked to a modern society were data science exists; therefore by only studying them separately, we fail to gain the full picture of our reality and deny ourselves the future opportunities. 
As with Venn diagrams, unique and worthwhile points of value can be realized through the understanding of areas of overlap and interaction. Therefore, exploring data science under a conservation-focused lens my provide some useful insight for all associated fields.

### Statement: 

Maslow’s hierarchy of needs has been applied to many fields outside of the business domain. This structure’s applicability to the area of data science should be no different. In fact, the specific application of Maslow’s eight-level hierarchy of needs to the practice of data science skills may likely support works related to the digital humanities and biocultural diversity efforts.

### Research question: 

What are the benefits of applying Maslow's hierarchy of needs to data science studies? *Can the application of Maslow's hierarchy of needs to data science studies intrinsically support the digital humanities and biocultural diversity efforts?*

### Hypothesis: 

Applying all eight levels of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs to data science studies will intrinsically support the digital humanities and biocultural diversity efforts.

### Null hypothesis: 

Applying all eight levels of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs to data science studies will have no effect on digital humanities and biocultural diversity efforts.
