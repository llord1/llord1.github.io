### Brief Introduction: 

Due to the growing amounts of data being globally generated daily, there is an increasing demand for exploration and quantitative backing of matters that were previously unquantifiable.  For example, while some recognize the importance of conservation and cultural activities in society, quantifiable support is often lacking. A vicious cycle is created when the funding for the exploration of these matters is reduced or denied, due to a scarcity of quantifiable evidence that supports its relevance.

Data science is a growing field, and its existence can be recognized as providing support to various areas of academia. The link between data science and the studies of humanities and biocultural diversity rarely recognized; the latter topics are more likely to be associated with more physically demanding skills rather than research. However, digital humanities and biocultural diversity studies are academic areas that attempt to investigate these areas to add quantifiable research to their importance.Ecological and cultural fields of study are now inextricably linked to a modern society were data science exists; therefore by only studying them separately, we fail to gain the full picture of our reality and deny ourselves the future opportunities. 
As with Venn diagrams, unique and worthwhile points of value can be realized through the understanding of areas of overlap and interaction. Therefore, exploring data science under a conservation-focused lens my provide some useful insight for all associated fields.

### Statement: 

Maslow’s hierarchy of needs has been applied to many fields outside of the business domain. This structure’s applicability to the area of data science should be no different. In fact, the specific application of Maslow’s eight-level hierarchy of needs to the practice of data science skills may likely support works related to the digital humanities and biocultural diversity efforts.

### Research question: 

What are the benefits of applying Maslow's hierarchy of needs to data science studies? *Can the application of Maslow's hierarchy of needs to data science studies intrinsically support the digital humanities and biocultural diversity efforts?*

### Hypothesis: 

Applying all eight levels of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs to data science studies will intrinsically support the digital humanities and biocultural diversity efforts

### Null hypothesis: 

Applying all eight levels of Maslow’s hierarchy of needs to data science studies will have no effect on digital humanities and biocultural diversity efforts.


### Proposed Framework: 

**The Data Science Biocultural Diversity Action (DSBD) Framework: Reenvisioning Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs for Data Science and Biocultural Diversity Efforts**

*Novel diagnosis and prescriptive frameworks for assessing oneself and surroundings and exploring the prescriptions of various modern data science tools towards amelioration.*



### Questions related to the Framework's Eight Levels: 

- __*Can Maslow’s "Biological and physiological needs" level be sufficiently explored in data science under a new lens of "Ambience"?

- Can Maslow’s __*"Safety and security needs"*__  level be sufficiently explored in data science under a new lens of __*"Assets"*__?

- Can Maslow’s __*"Love and belonging needs"*__  level be sufficiently explored in data science under a new lens of __*"Affiliation"*__?

- Can Maslow’s __*"Self-esteem needs"*__ level be sufficiently explored in data science under a new lens of __*"Attitudes"*__?

- Can Maslow’s __*"Cognitive needs"*__ level be sufficiently explored in data science under a new lens of __*"Analysis"*__?

- Can Maslow’s __*"Aesthetic needs"*__ level be sufficiently explored in data science under a new lens of __*"Artistry"*__?

- Can Maslow’s __*"Self-actualization needs"*__ level be sufficiently explored in data science under a new lens of __*"Awareness"*__?

- Can Maslow’s __*"Transcendence needs"*__ level be sufficiently explored in data science under a new lens of __*"Altruism"*__?
