In 2020, a new pandemic began, and the modern world became acutely aware of several of its failings. This pandemic highlighted various forms of societal inequities, that manifested in the overwhelming of healthcare systems, extreme governmental bureaucracy and corruption, and even extreme forms of systemic discrimination and racism. Most countries urged their citizens to remain indoors to slow the spread of the virus. 

This time of isolation, however, did facilitate a much needed period of reflection in society. Some families that were confined together became closer, and technology bridged the gap with communicated with persons over long distances. This time of reflection also allowed persons to rethink current societal institutions, the industries that are prioritized and promoted over others, and it emboldened others actively seek increased equality for all. 

Notably, as modern commerce ground to a halt, the environment appeared to thrive. In some areas, the air quality improved, others noted less accidental animal killings along transportation routes. In fact, wildlife began to flourish in some areas and even appeared to begin venture out into once-bustling commercial areas. This period of lockdown has not beneficial for all animals; in extreme cases, the policing of poachers is reduced, and animals in captivity that rely on tourism and public gathers are noting reduced funding. However, previously problematic proposals for policy changes, have been reconsidered and there are renewed efforts to investigate biodiversity conservation. On a small scale, some institutions have been able to secure approvals for extending nature reserves. On a larger scale, despite some regulatory rollbacks, as of July 7th, climate activists saw celebrated the abandonment of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, and the shut-down and emptying of the Dakota Access Pipeline pending a long-awaited thorough environmental review.

While we are indeed still far away from noting the true societal and environmental cost of the pandemic, global citizens can strive to set policies in place and continuously assess ourselves in these areas, to ensure that our situation can only improve. True value can be ascertained from studies in the areas of Digital Humanities and Biocultural Diversity (BCD), that specifically focus on the intrinsic connection between societal structures and its possible harmony with their surroundings. The former can be interpreted as being at the intersection of computing or digital technologies and the disciplines of the humanities; it can be the strategic a systematic implementation and utilization of digital resources on the study of the humanities and further analysis of their application. For example, this can take the form of creating digital art using Neural Style Transfer techniques and Tensorflow tools, creating new literature from recurrent neural networks, as well as deciphering ancient text from images and scans of relics. As co-founder and director of Terralingua, a pioneer in this area of study, Luisa Maffi has explained the interrelated (and possibly coevolved)  nature of the diversity of all forms of life within a complex socio-ecological adaptive system. According to Maffi, biological, cultural, and linguistic complexity add to various forms of the diversity of life. In fact, momentum is gathering for BCD to be included in the "conceptual repertoire" of researchers and policy-makers.

Motivation is essential to change, however, to properly allocate resources, data collection and analysis should occur. Data science offers a plethora of tools in which to explore our world. However, it is often a difficult task to decipher what tools to use and when. Developing the skill and capacity to achieve this requires quite a bit of study. It also requires a significant degree of concern and compassion to dedicate resources into research that may not have a direct, immediate, or substantial financial reward. 

My aim is to provide a framework in which Data Science can be utilized for Digital Humanities and Biocultural Diversity efforts which may lead to a more wholesome and sustainable future. This is an interdisciplinary exploration of the data science's hierarchy of needed skills, through a novel digital humanities and biocultural diversity topic lens. I will present novel diagnosis and prescriptive frameworks for assessing the current state of a country and exploring the prescription of various modern data science tools towards ameliorating its status utilizing the least amount of resources. The goal is to have this system simplified enough to allow to enable citizen scientists to make valuable academic contributions.
