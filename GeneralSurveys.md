### Introduction:

My dissertation aimed to propose novel natural language processing (NLP) strategies to promote the revitalization and preservation of low-resource languages. Most current language models do not focus on or have difficultly with handling low-resource languages - particularly creoles. I introduce models for tackling the various complications of dealing with such languages.

I attempted to utilize an assumed low-resource creole language of Saint Lucian Kwéyòl (also known as Antillean Creole French - ACF). However, in my research, I found a lack of definitive information on the current status of the Kwéyòl language. As part of that, I have attempted to use surveys to establish foundational truths about the current vitality status of the Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language. Ultimately, one cannot claim to have successfully aided in the revitalization or preservation of a language, without first reviewing its current status. This lack of Kwéyòl language resources presented a unique opportunity to bolster my dissertation by pairing an exploration of the current status of an assumed low-resource language and the NLP exploration of a low-resource language (such as a creole).

In an attempt to bolster the execution of the current Saint Lucian national language policy, I hope to conduct a series of language surveys, with particular attention to the vitality of the Kwéyòl language. This undertaking seeks to create quantifiable data on the current status of the language throughout various critical members of the Saint Lucian labor force and society at large. The work of teachers, medical workers, lawyers, and law enforcement, typically encompasses frequent interactions with people of varying backgrounds in Saint Lucia. Due to the increasingly multilingual landscape, effective communication on the island increasingly may involve applying various language skills to meet each situation.

These surveys are essential to supporting the updated Saint Lucian National Language Policy. Without quantifiable base metrics, it may be challenging to monitor and gauge the amelioration of the current language conditions. For example, it would be difficult to establish facts about the improvement of nationwide Kwéyòl literacy without ever exploring the current capabilities of the public. Moreover, without the data collected from these surveys, it would be difficult to move forward with the efficient allocation of resources to national language services. For example, one would be unable to definitively confirm if and which communities are more Kwéyòl literate than others, and if and how the skills of those communities can be effectively leveraged to aid the weaker ones.

It should also be noted that these language surveys seek to provide information not available in previous language surveys. Most of the past ones appear to request information on how the community 'feels' about the current situation and also inquired into the public's opinions and suggestions for improvement and resource allocation strategies. However, these surveys will attempt to focus on the actual experiences based on their exposure to various languages and to quantify the linguistic capabilities of the public. Moreover, one survey will specifically focus on quantifying the vitality of the Kwéyòl language. 

The distribution of surveys has begun. The Bar Association of Saint Lucia assisted in the distribution of one language survey to its lawyers; it aimed to explore lawyers' multilingual capabilities and the language resources available to their clients. Another survey is underway with the Saint Lucian Ministry of Education. This survey aimed at conducting a teacher survey to gauge the role that multilingualism plays in their interactions with students. A few more surveys may be attempted before the end of my dissertation period, particularly an island-wide survey into the vitality of the Kwéyòl language. Most of the remaining surveys are already in their draft stage; distribution of which may be ideal for the upcoming Kwéyòl festivities in October (Jounen Kwéyòl).
