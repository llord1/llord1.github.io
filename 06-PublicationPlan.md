#### __Publication Plan__

The publication process can be viewed as an essential part of one's Ph.D. solidification in the field. While publications before graduation from a program can at times be difficult, it may be advantageous to attempt this as part of one's ultimate success in the field. A publication plan allows one to market their results to places that are more apt to appreciate one's works; this allows one to ensure that their contributions are better recognized by industry professionals. Some have viewed such publications as providing a powerful and significant indicator for 'scientific career advancement' {% cite giebel_2019 %}; this is particularly important in a highly competitive field.

My works will focus on natural language processing with low-resource languages, with a focus on creoles (particularly Saint Lucian Kwéyòl).
To summarize, I wish to publish my foundational works in the form of survey reports on the subject language of this NLP dissertation in Chapter One of my dissertation. My major computational works will be published and noted as Chapters Two through Four (with the inclusion of a publication of the complied language data of the dissertation).

The Association for Computational Linguistics will be targeted as the main publisher of my works as the theme for the upcoming 60th Annual Meeting suitably supports most, if not all, of my research efforts; “Language Diversity: from Low-Resource to Endangered Languages. 

Relevant submission topics for the conference include, but are not limited to, 'Computational Social Science and Cultural Analytics'; 'Machine Translation and Multilinguality', 'NLP Applications'; 'Information Extraction'; 'Information Retrieval and Text Mining'; 'Phonology, Morphology, and Word Segmentation'; and 'Syntax: Tagging, Chunking and Parsing'. 

This publisher is currently seeking papers that 'discuss and reflect on the “role of the speech and language technologies in sustaining language use” .. for the large variety of world languages with focus on under-resourced, indigenous, and/or endangered languages. What are the challenges for developing and scaling up the current NLP technologies for the rich diversity of human languages and what are the ethical, cultural and policy implications of such technologies for the local communities? This publisher invites researchers to 'submit position, opinion, modelling, and resource papers' on topics that are indeed explored in my works thus far. All areas of calls for papers appear to apply to my works; the following descriptions are indeed apt {% cite acl_greg2807_2021 acl_2021 %}.

*-Reflecting on the NLP community’s current progress on building speech and language technologies for under-resourced, indigenous and/or endangered languages and how we can make meaningful advances in the future.*

*-Quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods to assess the impact of NLP research for sustaining language maintenance and use for the large diversity of world languages.*

*-Ways in which NLP practitioners can partner with language communities to develop impactful research (including data collection) and applications that can help sustain language use for indigenous and/or endangered languages, including such impacts as the development of teaching and learning materials for both children and adults.*

The conference occurs from May 22nd to 27th 2022, in Dublin. The paper submission deadline is November 15, 2021, and Notification of acceptance
is February 20, 2022 {% cite acl_2021 %}.

However, this does not mean that other publishers will be ignored. My dissertation has involved foundational surveys as means of creating unique quantifiable data on the environment in which the rest of my works are based. These explore the status of a sample subject language through studying various critical members of that society's labor force. The work of teachers, medical workers (in the realms of both physical and mental health), lawyers, and law enforcement, typically encompasses frequent interactions with people of varying backgrounds in that environment. The 2021 publication of Dr. Sandra Evans in Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages, ‘Ou ni right-la pou remain silans’ The case for a standard Kwéyòl translation of the pre-trial right to silence', supports the academic merit of conducting surveys on language and law enforcement in Saint Lucia {% cite evans2021ni %}. That publication is right in line with a similar foundational survey within this dissertation that focuses on linguistics and the justice system in Saint Lucia. More specifically, this was a linguistic survey of the current multilingual capacities of the island's lawyers, in an effort to assess legal language services with the hopes of avoiding miscarriages of justice due to miscommunication between lawyers and clients. Interested entities such as the Bar Association of Saint Lucia, The Central Statistical Office of Saint Lucia, and the Saint Lucia Folk Research Center, are currently awaiting the results of this IRB-approved work.

I also have an upcoming law enforcement survey. It will focus on law enforcement as they (like lawyers) are all employed in critical services that require effective communication in an increasingly multilingual setting. Dr. Sandra Evans paper appears to have focused on the potential for miscarriages of justice due to miscommunication {% cite evans2021ni %}. My upcoming works focus on *avoiding* miscarriages of justice due to miscommunication. The work will simultaneously bolster the vitality (and recognition) of Kwéyòl, by encouraging mandatory education and monitoring of the local heritage language in critical institutions.

Ultimately, it is hoped that the results of these surveys can also published in the *Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages (JPCL)* {% cite benjamins.com_2021 %}. While there are other linguistic journals available, this one seems to be the best aligned with my subject matter; it appears to accept various linguistic works including sociolinguistics, and computational linguistics. However, the Society for Caribbean Linguistics (SCL) will serve as an additional possible publisher of all facets of the work being conducted in this dissertation, via its SCL Occasional Papers (OP) Series, and the SCL Popular Papers (PP) Series. {% cite scl_2021 scl_2021pub %}. The surveys will be conducted on as many of these professions as possible, before December 2021. These surveys have been slated for distribution while I continue to complete my other major coded/ data model papers. 

The bulk of work regarding computational linguistics will be published in other academic journals. For example, another main target is a recently created publication geared towards data science papers - *Patterns*. It is said to publish

*'...original research in data science, particularly focusing on solutions to the cross-disciplinary problems that all researchers face when dealing with data, and articles about datasets, software code, algorithms, infrastructures, etc., with permanent links to these research outputs'. Patterns also promotes cross-community conversation by publishing opinion pieces and review articles* {% cite patterns_2020 %}. Since I do intend to discuss matters related to computational linguistics, frameworks, and my dissertation's societal value to low-resource languages (biocultural diversity topics), I do believe that this is an appropriate target. 

Additionally, Easychair claims to support "a large number of conference models and, judging by our Web traffic, is the world's largest conference management system" {% cite easychair2021 %}. 

Ultimately, in addition to publishing survey reports, and computational papers, I also hope to publish my collection of complied Kwéyòl language samples. Currently, I am in discussions with several committees of the Saint Lucian government that are considering hosting and publishing the reports, as well as the complied Kwéyòl text data. However, I publishers of this data may also include the aforementioned JPCL and the SCL.

I am indeed collecting multilingual corpora for a low-resource language as part of my ongoing dissertation work. These range from national documents such as the Saint Lucian national anthem {% cite anthem_2016 %}, speeches from government officials' published press releases bearing Kwéyòl dialogue {% cite louisy_govt_2004 knowledgewalkinstitute_2021 %}, {% cite louisy_govt_2004 knowledgewalkinstitute_2021 %}, Kwéyòl financial document excerpts from the Saint Lucian National Bank's annual reports {% cite national_bank_of_st. lucia_2020 %}, poems from national poetry competitions, and local folktales published through collaborative efforts of the local government and SIL International,  {% cite sil_folktale_1985 sil_readingbook_1989 %}. The collection also includes public data on open forum Kwéyòl mentions on social media; particularly the postings by verified fluent Saint Lucian Kwéyòl writers {% cite kweyol_fb_joseph kweyol_works_joseph kweyol_playlists_joseph%}. 

I believe this data would be a unique submission as I would compiling all these far-flung works of differing semantic domains and converting them from their various publication formats into analyzable text files.
