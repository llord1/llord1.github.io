## __*Transcendence needs*__ can be explored as topics related to __*Altruism*__.   



 __Issue: __

An online creole dictionary resource has been provided by SIL(Summer Institute of Linguistics) International Publications, however, it is incomplete. Many words are missing altogether, and some present words bearing multiple meanings (many of which are not stated). 

 __Questions:__

 Is there an existing model for implementing community discussion of dictionaries?  Is it possible to create an infrastructure for community collaboration of an endangered language?
Is it possible to explore the implementation of an online dictionary resource through a systems dynamic model? And would other models be more applicable (for example, the application of the predator-prey Lotka-Volterra model,  or the WORLD3 Model)?

 __Discussion:__

Online dictionaries allow users and compilers opportunities far beyond those of traditional publishing constructions. For an endangered language, the use of such a resource becoming increasingly essential. However, the use of static online dictionaries may not be sufficient to meet the demands of language that is slowly dying. Static dictionaries with dynamic qualities may better serve to the needs of cataloging an endangered language. 

Online dictionaries can benefit from using technology to update their records regularly. This not only pertains to new sections of the alphabet but "also with words of particular interest to its users at the time". Words such as LOL and YOLO were online slangs that were added to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) in 2011, and 2016 respectively. The third edition of the OED appears to no longer suppress widely‑used slang terms, however, it certainly is incapable of documenting the meaning and use of every fleeting term used among small assortments of speakers within the entirety of English‑speaking world.

The Urban Dictionary is the free service of an online dictionary of contemporary English slang usage; it is a "collaborative project of over 1 million definitions for over 400,000 unique headwords". It serves as an online lexicography where public contributors explain the meanings of words and phrases not readily covered by traditional dictionaries; contributors collaborate, cooperate, and compete for meaning-making. Eventually, depending on the proliferation of use in society, official dictionaries, such as OED, may elect to officially adopt a word from such a collection.

The collaborative compilation of online lexicography, therefore, is known to linguistics. In fact, there is a webpage, similar to Urban Dictionary, that strategically caters to Caribbean consumers. While the region bears various peoples with differing histories, they do share similarities; while most of these similarities are the unfortunate result of colonialization from similar superpowers, certain words are ubiquitous due to the ease of traversing and settling in neighboring countries. Persons of these areas experience similar flora and fauna, and environmental and social phenomena that are endemic to their setting and way of life. The website, Wiwords, is a dynamic online dictionary that highlights instances of shared vocabulary, as well as allowing for contributions that are unique to certain countries in the Caribbean.

It should, however, be noted that Saint Lucians do not appear to be highly active in this online linguistic community. For example, there are no contributions to the section outlined for local "quotes" or sayings, when these are quite abundant in the local language. Most participation from Saint Lucia pertains to discussions of food, and animal and plant life.

Overall, the Antillean creole spoken in Saint Lucia can benefit from utilizing online language resources. This instance of a dynamic online community dictionary is very useful in keeping certain words active. However, there are flaws in this structure that can be improved upon. Public contributors may understand the language in terms of speaking it, however, they may not be the best teachers; that is to say that contributors may not always be clear in their explanations or contributions. Overall, straying from official spellings of words can contribute to data entry issues. For example, one can observe the accents used with "chofé" - "to heat up",  and "chofè" - a "driver". These words without context and accents would be very difficult to decipher. Persons being inaccurately applying accents, or unable to access the necessary unique characters were required (diacritics) for formal grammar can present problems in documenting the language.

Another issue with dictionary compilation in this region may deal with the overlap of meanings attributed to certain words. Many-to one-relations between words and their meanings (e.g. homonymy and polysemy) are often not included in lists when studying this grammatical phenomenon for a unique language like creole. In addition to synonyms, frequent polysemy, the presence of homonyms and homophones and the phenomena sometimes referred to as the “false friends” of the translator.
Dictionaries recognize the distinction between polysemy and
homonymy by making a polysemous item a single dictionary entry
and making homophonous lexemes two or more separate entries; polysemous terms can though different can be derived from one basic idea, and the related terms reflect that image.

Polysemy is a common occurrence in the endangered language of Saint Lucian Antillean creole. An indication of a polysemous verb in English, is one that corresponds to different verbs when translated into other languages. For example, one can review the English word for "ask" (for information) and "ask" (for action); this can be interpreted as one word "vragen" in Dutch, however, the majority of other languages use different words for each interpretation in English, like "fragen" and "bitten" in German, and "preguntar" and "pedir" in Spanish . In Saint Lucian creole,  this can be seen

Even the word, "Creole" can be viewed as a contested, polysemous term in the English language. The term has been used at different times and in various geographical regions to describe distinct identities, languages, peoples, ethnicities, racial heritages, and cultural artefacts.

Moreover, Sasse (2001) lists ten changes occurring during language obsolescence;  several of which bear similarities to those described by Campbell & Muntzel (1989) and Palosaari & Campbell (2011), namely: *loss of phonological distinctions, regularization of morphophonemics, loss of function words, analyticity, loss of morphology, loss of syntactic complexity, agrammatism, phonological and grammatical variability, reduction of vocabulary, and an increase in polysemy*.

However, this polysemy is, in fact, the premise of much of the active literature in this language. Calypso and other forms of music in this language, may celebrate this ability to utilize words or phrases with double meanings to discuss crude topics without being direct. Philips suggested that Calypsos can engage this method via ‘lamina lyrics’. *Much like an onion, these Calypsos have a number of different levels of meaning, concealed one underneath the other. Achieving this phenomenon, Calypsonians use frames and masks that manifest in Calypsos as a metaphor, metonym, polysemy, irony, and satire*. 

Despite having a few members of “native speaking generation” left, often communities lack the implementation of structures dedicated to the retention of language.  Successive generations may require resources that express the necessity of the language as well as its desirability to ensure its continuance.


Mohan is of the view that"
*living languages do not die when the last trace of memory has vanished. They are actually dead much before this, but may be lent an artificial semblance of life by sympathetic post-users from outside its system. (1979:42)*.

To futher quote Mohan, an obsolescent language:
*is actually dead before its forms have totally disappeared, in two different senses. A small part of the non-native speaking generation has preserved dead tokens of the language. Also, the time gap between the age of the youngest native speaker and the latest possible age of language acquisition, in infancy, shows the language dead at its source, but with a now finite community of native speakers continuing, like the earlier light of a dead star, to travel its original course and give an illusion picture of vitality. (313)



Perceptions of the locals' attitudes towards the creole language are often complicated. In 1998, Frank explored, and even expanded the written form of the creole language in Saint Lucia while attempting to effectively translate the English bible into the local language; upon concluding his tasks he remarked that the bible would indirectly boost creole literacy through the motivational passages of the bible.
 "... for all practical purposes Creole remains an unwritten language for the majority of the population, which remains unaware of the books published in Creole. Attempts to teach Creole literacy have not met with much success because of lack of interest. Motivation is the most important factor in the success of any literacy program, and having something people want to read is the most important motivating factor". 


This ultimately leaves one to wonder if it is logical and possible to merge an official online static dictionary with a dynamic slang dictionary to increase fluency of an endangered language? Such as system would require access to an existing dictionary, as well as opportunities for dictionary contributions. The creation of an interactive dictionary may assist with reinvigorating the usage of the language through active use and contributions to this resource, but also offer opportunities to actively discuss and clarify words and concepts associated with creole.
