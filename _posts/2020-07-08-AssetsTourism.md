### __*Safety and security needs*__ can be explored as topics related to __*Assets*__.

### Introduction:

What impact, if any, does tourism have on the vitality of the Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language? What factors elevated the prestige language on over the heritage language? For example, are tourists likely to move freely throughout all communities, or just certain ones based on the number of tourist attractions or ease of transportation (based on infrastructure)? Consequently, vendors of those communities may frequently defer to the prestige language when engaging in tourists due to the positive reinforcement associated with a successful sale. Also, are educational facilities of impressionable youths located near tourist hubs? 

This study would entail observing data on various areas of interest related to tourism in Saint Lucia. For example, examining data on the number of tourist attractions per district, number of hotels per district,  the ports of entry per district, number of jobs related to tourism per district, number of educational facilities per district, and the number of main government offices per district. The final details may lead to a discussion of language hotspots; and a possible explanation of their existence.
