## __*Safety and security needs*__ can be explored as topics related to __*Assets*__.

## Questions:

+ Assessing the link between crime and language. Could miscommunication between prestige and heritage language speakers hinder legal defenses? Are there any metrics on lawyers' multilingual lawyers on the island? Are there any laws related to representation requirements (do lawyers assess the language needs of clients to decide how best to assist them)? What are the rates of incarceration of predominantly Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language speakers? What are the inmate metrics per district of origin (there is a popular belief that most Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language speakers are located in the Southern part of the country)?

## Introduction:

The American Bar Association does gather Legal Profession Statistics; their current statistical data is used to assist with research on lawyers and the legal profession. Their website notes data on the topics of Lawyer Demographics (including matters of Disability, Women, and Minority/People of Color). It also encompasses Justice System Statistics (including topics on Public Perception of Justice System/Lawyers and the Justice System), Court Statistics (including Cases Filed, and Criminal Justice Statistics). This association also notes the topics of Law Students and Education and Legal Salaries (and related Attrition/Retention data).

Lawyer demographics in Saint Lucia do not appear to be gathered. A representative of The Central Statistical Office of Saint Lucia stated that the data in the country's "Labourforce survey is not disaggregated in such a way to get a count of all lawyers". It was also stated that since the Labourforce survey "utilizes a sample if it were to give a figure it would not be representative". 

## Methodology: Chi-square test of independence

### Survey design (questions)

+ *Which category below includes your age?*

This question is posed as a standard demographic question, yet it is also important as speaks to the current and future state of the legal linguistic environment. Noting age may highlight multilingualism trends among age groups. For example, if multilingualism is more prominent in the younger lawyers, then the projection of multilingual representation would be positive. However, if multilingual tendencies are clustered among older lawyers, then this study may serve to highlight needed points of improvement in the legal system in an increasingly multilingual society.

This age grouping was chosen because lawyers typically obtain higher education levels beyond high-school, and remain in practice past the age of 65 [source]
