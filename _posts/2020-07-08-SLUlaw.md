## __*Safety and security needs*__ can be explored as topics related to __*Assets*__.

+ Assessing the link between crime and language. Could miscommunication between prestige and heritage language speakers hinder legal defenses? Are there any metrics on lawyers' multilingual lawyers on the island? Are there any laws related to representation requirements (do lawyers assess the language needs of clients to decide how best to assist them)? What are the rates of incarceration of predominantly Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language speakers? What are the inmate metrics per district of origin (there is a popular belief that most Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language speakers are located in the Southern part of the country)?
