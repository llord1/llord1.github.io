+ What language learning tools are most effective with acquiring Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language? A comparison of specially curated Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language of Language learning tools: discussion of the value of puzzles for language acquisition and familiarity (word search puzzles), discussion of curated mnemonic tools, and language learning mobile applications.



### Introduction:
Spanish of top languages spoken and taught in most high schools in Saint Lucia. Therefore, any linguistic investigations that would enhance Spanish acquisition in society. Data visualization can improve the ease with which individuals can absorb information. Languages are indeed data, albeit well-established corpora. Data visualization of languages is often explored by teachers; however, the standards of visualizations vary as teachers are often expected to create unique learning tools to explain standard course material to each new class. They are encouraged to keep the data visualization of the age-old corpora fresh. They are increasingly expected to incorporate technology into their works where possible. However, the application of the latest forms of technology is not always suitable; at times, simplicity is indeed the best option. Therefore, the goal here is to investigate the established forms of data visualization when teaching languages and attempt to rank them. Ranking can assist with forming future recommendations for the teaching of specific topics.
 

Since the teaching and learning of languages can be very complicated and require several years, this investigation will focus on a set topic in the language. Being able to express a "state of being" is very important to communication. In English, this matter can be rather simple, as one can be happy, be skinny, be an adult, or be a lawyer,  or describe the weather as being hot, or the time as being midday. In Spanish, describing the state of being can be more complicated; the state of being can be expressed by the verbs "Ser" and "Estar".
For example, "Ser" can describe where an event takes place, ownership, relationships, professions or occupations, express time, or weather of a place. On the other hand, "Estar", for example, can be used to express states of health,  mood, locations, ongoing actions, used when describing food and appearance, or used when describing the changing weather.
In linguistics, when conjugating verbs, there can be a need to acknowledge various groupings of people. This can be referred to as the different forms of "personhood". This can be first, second, and third-person singular, and again in their plural forms; such is the case for the Spanish language.


The teaching of Spanish verbs typically involves the teaching of verbs using simple tables. While not very visually interesting, this is the standard. Other teachers may attempt to make this information more visually appealing by displaying images of these personal groupings, and then adding their related labels. Some teachers have unofficially adopted the "shoe/boot verbs method" to visualize verb conjugation. Another less popular method in the US is the "hand method". This form assigns persons to fingers on one's hand. This method is reminiscent of the Guidonian hand mnemonic device, that had been used to aid singers in studying to sight-sing. This form, however, excludes the second-person-plural version of verbs. It has recently been suggested this hand mnemonic device, can be adapted to include all the verb conjugation details. The vosotros form can be acknowledged as special rather than being ignored; this uniqueness can be highlighted through its association with the ring finger.

This study will attempt to compare the effectiveness of each visualization in assisting students to acquire the language. "Ser" will be used as the example verb to be conjugated. Verbs will be conjugated, there will be sample sentences; all forms will use the same sample sentence.
