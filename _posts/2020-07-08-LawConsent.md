## __Purpose of the Study*__

The purpose of this research is to identify patterns of linguistic legal representation on the multilingual island of Saint Lucia; there will be specific focus on the second most prevalent language, yet endangered, heritage language of “Saint Lucian Kwéyòl”. The responses of participants will run be through textual analytical tools to provide insight on the legal environment that Saint Lucians, particularly Kwéyòl speakers, face.
  

## __Participant tasks*__

Each participant is asked to fill out an online survey to provide their basic demographic details, opinions of their multilingual capacities, and the current linguistic legal environment. Due to the simplistic nature of the questions, each participant is expected to be able to complete the form in less than 30 minutes.
  

## __Participant Risks and Discomforts*__ 

There is no anticipated risk for the participant in this research. All information will be protected, and the confidentiality of the data will be maintained throughout the course of this research. 
  

## __Survey Benefits*__ 

Collection of profession specific labor statistic data is uncommon in Saint Lucia, and there appears to be low societal consideration of the increasing multilingual environment; therefore, data collection and  analysis of this specific occupation could provide a template for profession specific data collection, and improve legal representation.
  

## __Participant Compensation*__

There is no compensation for participation.
  

## __Privacy/Confidentiality/Data Security*__

The data collected will be saved in a standard hard drive for three years; non-identifiable data will be submitted to the Bar Association of Saint Lucia, and The Central Statistical Office of Saint Lucia.


## __Participation is Voluntary*__
