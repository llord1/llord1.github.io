### __*Safety and security needs*__ can be explored as topics related to __*Assets*__.

### Introduction:

In a time of crisis, such as the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, Maslow's theory of needs aids in visualizing and prioritizing scarce resources based on an individual's needs {% cite maslow_1943_2000 mcleod_2020 matias2020human casale2020interpersonally wong2020healing %}. Often, obtaining our needs is intrinsically linked to the ease with which we are able to communicate - our ability to understand and to be understood. To effectively facilitate the communication of various societal needs, data science can be employed as a means of monitoring and maintaining the standards of numerous fields through the careful study of an environment's linguistics.

For example, our sense of safety and security can be linked to the ease with which we can understand the medical advice being relayed to us by medical professionals or their ability to understand the symptoms we describe. As recently as 2019, Sweden conducted a national study on health care professionals' communications through interpreters; an investigation occurred after noting that many parents utilizing neonatal care were foreign-born and unable to effectively communicate with the healthcare professionals in the local language, {% cite patriksson2019health %}.  In 2013, linguistic one work highlighted communications issues between physicians and Spanish-speaking Latin American women with pelvic floor disorders {% cite sevilla2013communication %}. This study highlighted that apart from patients’ lack of understanding concerning the disease, there was a lack of Spanish proficiency among the participating physicians. Even in 2009, there was a study done on competent peer support intervention for Spanish-speaking Latinas with breast cancer {% cite napoles2009developing %}. 

Notably, one of the areas most closely associated with ensuring societal safety and security would be a country's legal system. This system encompasses police officers and high courts, however, the position of utmost importance in navigating the legal system on an individual's behalf - one's voice in the court - would be their lawyer. Therefore, the effectiveness of communication between lawyers and the client can be fundamentally linked to that client's freedom. Data science can therefore be used as a means of monitoring and maintaining justice, through the exploration of legal data; trends may be uncovered on the probability of innocent or guilty verdicts, given the lawyer's capacity to communicate in the client's dominant language (mother tongue).

For example, the Caribbean can serve as a rich multilingual setting in which one can explore the relationship between law and linguistics. The 2006 case for Gerald Joseph's criminal appeal, served to highlight the importance of proper linguistic consideration for clients that speak heritage languages {% cite ecsc_2015}. Joseph (Appellant), was a Saint Lucian Kwéyòl speaker that requested a criminal appeal on six substantial grounds (and also appealed against the sentence). This appeal was ultimately granted, partly due to the argument that there was a possible issue with language barriers. At the appeal, representation stated that it was "totally unrealistic to have expected Joseph, who was illiterate and conversant only in kwéyòl, to have appreciated the nuances of a criminal trial that involved issues such as identification, credibility, good character, and recent complaint" {% cite ecsc_2015}. Proper legal representation and effective communication may have provided a different initial outcome in Joseph's case.

Noting the importance of effective communication between attornies and clients, it would be socially beneficial to gather data on legal cases and with any lingual component. One could, therefore, determine if there is a higher likelihood of an innocent or guilty verdict based on the alignment of the client's dominant language (mother tongue) and the lawyer being able to understand them. However, it should be noted that most legal systems tend to offer the assistance of Court-appointed interpreters; yet, reducing communication gaps through direct attorney-client communication would be the ideal situation for legal representation.

### Current goals:

Find sufficient case examples/ court data; attempt to find precise linguistic components if they exist.

This will begin with cases in the Caribbean region (as this is a highly multilingual setting); if the data is insufficient parameters will be widened.

Settle on a model once sufficient data has been identified.

Shop the developed idea to various journals.
