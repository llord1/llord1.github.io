## Product #1
How effective has the vocabulary of Indian origin been in its contribution to St. Lucian Creole Vocabulary? Are the words strictly isolated to food, and a few racial descriptors?



### Hypothesis: Vocabulary of Indian origin are present in low rates and strictly isolated to food and racial descriptors.

### Null hypothesis: Vocabulary of Indian origin has no effect on beyond food and racial descriptors.


### Commentary:
One may find data to support this experiment as Trinidad has a high Indian population of creole speakers, and Antillean creole shares some vocabulary (can check Wiwords for similarities).


The only relevant literature on this topic thus far is a statement on one of SIL's reports :
"Vocabulary of Indian Origin. Most of the few words in St. Lucian Creole of Indian origin have to do with cuisine: dal (Hindi), dalpouri, goulgoula, gwodja, kirou, kòri (Tamil), mango (Tamil), roti (Hindi), sohari and talkari. There are also two words, kouli [< Hindi qūlī ‘hired servant’] and dogla [< Hindi dogalaa ‘hybrid’], that have to do with ethnicity."
