&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Institutional Review Board&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harrisburg University of Science and Technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participation Consent Agreement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This linguistic research study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Harrisburg University of Science and Technology (HU). This research study is led by Laurel Lord, a Ph. D. candidate in Data Science Department at HU. The Faculty Advisor for this study is Dr. Ford, Professor of Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study is being conducted in compliance with the standards and guidelines given by the HU IRB. The Collaborative Institution Training Initiative (CITI) Program has certified the researcher, Laurel Lord, for human-subject research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purpose of the Study:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this research is to gather general demographic data of lawyers and identify patterns of linguistic legal representation on the multilingual island of Saint Lucia. There will be a specific focus on the second most prevalent language - “Saint Lucian Kwéyòl”. The responses of participants will be run through textual analytical tools to provide insight into the legal environment that Saint Lucians, particularly Kwéyòl speakers, experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participant Tasks:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each participant is asked to fill out an online survey to provide their basic demographic details, statements on their multilingual capacities, and statements on the current linguistic legal environment. The form contains eighteen questions that each participant may be able to complete in less than thirty minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participant Risks and Discomforts:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no anticipated risk for the participant in this research. All information will be protected, and the confidentiality of the data will be maintained throughout this research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Survey Benefits:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collection of profession-specific labor statistical data is uncommon in Saint Lucia. Additionally, there appears to be low societal consideration of the increasing multilingual environment; therefore, data collection and analysis of this specific profession could serve as a template for job-specific data collection and improve the legal representation offered to the inhabitants of Saint Lucia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participation is Voluntary:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Survey participation is voluntary, and individuals may choose not to participate if uncomfortable with answering any of the questions after signing the consent form by withdrawing from the survey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Participant Compensation:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no compensation for participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy/Confidentiality/Data Security:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data collected will be saved in a standard hard drive for three years; non-identifiable data, and a report, will be submitted to the Bar Association of Saint Lucia and The Central Statistical Office of Saint Lucia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inquires/Questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any questions may be directed to Laurel Lord at LAlord@my.harrisburgu.edu. Questions or concerns regarding your rights as a subject in this study may be directed to HU IRB via 717-901-5100 or their website at harrisburgu.edu.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Assets: Assessing the link between crime and language</title>

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;linguistics-and-maslows-safety-and-security-needs&quot;&gt;Linguistics and Maslow’s safety and security needs&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the extended period of social disruption caused by the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, many gained a newfound appreciation for Maslow’s theory on a hierarchy of needs &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#maslow_1943_2000&quot;&gt;(Maslow, 1943; Matias et al., 2020; Wong et al., 2020; Casale &amp;amp; Flett, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;. Global citizens reflected on the loss of lives, the loss of a sense of justice, the loss of financial stability, the subsequent loss of housing stability, and an overall sense of the loss of social normalcy. Many are also concerned about the severity and frequency of natural disasters that were increasingly impacting all forms of life within our complex global socio-ecological environment. In a time of crisis, Maslow’s theory can aid in visualizing and prioritizing scarce resources according to one’s needs, and data science can be used to explore, assess, and address those needs; data science can serve as a tool of establishing a degree of certainty, in uncertain times. Often, obtaining our needs is intrinsically linked to the ease with which we are able to communicate - our ability to understand and to be understood. To effectively facilitate the communication of various societal needs, data science can be employed as a means of monitoring and maintaining the standards of numerous fields through the careful study of an environment’s linguistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several careers in society can contribute to providing the general sense of safety and security that Maslow often discussed &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#diener2011happiness&quot;&gt;(Diener &amp;amp; Biswas-Diener, 2011)&lt;/a&gt;. Notably, obvious, yet often overlooked are issues concerning human communication. Miscommunication can mean the difference between life and death in some fields, particularly those of medical practitioners and members of the justice system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data science is the backbone for most research and is often the key that unlocks paradigm research. In Mattmann’s “vision for data science” he suggested that “for the specialism to emerge and grow, data scientists will have to overcome barriers that are common to multidisciplinary research” &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#mattmann2013vision&quot;&gt;(Mattmann, 2013)&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, thoughtful data collection and monitoring of these crucial services can improve the services provided to the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;linguistic-research-trends-in-safety-and-security-needs-fields&quot;&gt;Linguistic research trends in “safety and security needs” fields&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thoughtful deliberation of linguistics, particularly the consideration of language barriers, is increasing in many fields; this is most noticeable in the medical field as the effectiveness of communication can have a direct impact on the safety and security, in terms of the patient’s life. As recently as 2019, Sweden conducted a national study on health care professionals’ communications through interpreters; this study was conducted after noting that many parents utilizing neonatal care were foreign-born and unable to effectively communicate with the healthcare professionals in the local language &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#patriksson2019health&quot;&gt;(Patriksson et al., 2019)&lt;/a&gt;. In 2013, linguistic work had been done to highlight communications issues between physicians and Spanish-speaking Latin American women with pelvic floor disorders &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#sevilla2013communication&quot;&gt;(Sevilla et al., 2013)&lt;/a&gt;; this study highlighted that apart from patients’ lack of disease understanding, there was a lack of Spanish proficiency among the participating physicians. Another 2013 research project centered on the perceptions of patient-provider communication in breast and cervical cancer-related care when dealing with low-income English and Spanish-speaking women &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#simon2013perceptions&quot;&gt;(Simon et al., 2013)&lt;/a&gt;. Even in 2009, there was a study done on competent peer support intervention for Spanish-speaking Latinas with breast cancer &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#napoles2009developing&quot;&gt;(Nápoles-Springer et al., 2009)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the aforementioned cases mostly shifted the majority of the responsibility of effective communication to additional parties, such as regulated translators, rather than assessing a multilingual professional’s inherent communication skills. Studies are increasingly being attempted on professionals that can speak more than one language; investigations can include assessments of the sufficiency of their training materials when their primary language is not the dominant language of the country in which they practice. One study did investigate Spanish–English bilingual psychotherapists and their personal and professional language development and use &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#verdinelli2009spanish&quot;&gt;(Verdinelli &amp;amp; Biever, 2009)&lt;/a&gt;. Another study was conducted on instances where nurses double as interpreters (a study of Spanish-speaking patients in a US primary care setting) &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#elderkin2001nurses&quot;&gt;(Elderkin-Thompson et al., 2001)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the support from studies that demonstrated the importance of foreign language assistance programs, mistakes still occurred during the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Failed communication systems of a government department denied detainees informed consent, and therefore facilitated blatant medical malpractice on unwitting immigrant patients; there were notable instances of the performance of unnecessary services on captive multilingual immigrant patients &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#olivares_washington_ICE2020&quot;&gt;(Olivares &amp;amp; Washington, 2020; Treisman, 2020; BBC, 2020; Cassady, 2020; Lambe, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the presence of foreign language assistance resources, the utilization of these resources was not carefully monitored or enforced. In these situations, communication failures serve to highlight that failures to communicate and enforce the legal rights of these patients can also lead to life and death situations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;benefits-to-multilingual-law-practitioners&quot;&gt;Benefits to multilingual law practitioners&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investigations concerning linguistics and “safety and security needs” can also involve members of the justice system. Furthermore, there are also are benefits to be reaped by law practitioners. As of 2015, Brian Porro, the principal translator at the Directorate-General for Translation at the European Commission, eagerly sought to hire lawyer-linguists at the European Court of Justice; instead, he noted that there was “a dearth of suitably qualified prospective English candidates in law with an additional language” &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#ahmed_2015&quot;&gt;(Ahmed, 2015)&lt;/a&gt;. Therefore, this scarcity of capable multilingual lawyers may allow for international law firms to extend higher salaries to bilingual employees. Further, Porro suggested that speaking additional languages facilitated better communication. He added that the very presence of a sub-discipline could highlight one’s ability to concentrate and deploy your language skills in legal practice &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#ahmed_2015&quot;&gt;(Ahmed, 2015)&lt;/a&gt;. He also notes that one’s language skills could also provide opportunities to work abroad &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#ahmed_2015&quot;&gt;(Ahmed, 2015)&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, it does appear that inhabitants of multilingual societies would benefit from having figures of law enforcement, and practice, being able to effectively communicate in these languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;law-and-linguistics-in-a-multilingual-setting&quot;&gt;Law and linguistics in a multilingual setting&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To address the public’s “safety and security needs” lawyers can take on multiple roles, where they can enforce laws and maintain peace. Notably, they can also serve as change agents when addressing flaws in existing laws or proposing laws to meet new public “safety and security needs”. Andras Sajo’s 1993 work on the &lt;em&gt;“Role of Lawyers in Social Change”&lt;/em&gt; highlighted instances, in the country of Hungary, where lawyers exuded direct and indirect political and social influences &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#sajo1993role&quot;&gt;(Sajo, 1993)&lt;/a&gt;. Overall his work supports the idea that the power wielded by elite figures, such as lawyers, can have an intense impact on society &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#sajo1993role&quot;&gt;(Sajo, 1993; UMassAmherst, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;. He suggested that lawyers as a profession, &lt;em&gt;“function in society as keepers of the law, through courts and/or through avoiding and channeling contracts with law-enforcing mechanisms”&lt;/em&gt;. Sajo noted that Hungary was a &lt;em&gt;“lawyer-dominated society, both in terms of the percentage of lawyers among the intellectual elite and the importance of legal dispute handling”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#sajo1993role&quot;&gt;(Sajo, 1993)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also spoke of these lawyers as being part of the &lt;em&gt;“intellighentzia”&lt;/em&gt; as being &lt;em&gt;“elite professionals independent from employment relations or at least appearing independent”&lt;/em&gt;, and highlighted their vital part in Eastern European social changes, especially as those changes were &lt;em&gt;traditionally related to national independence movements in the last 150-200 years&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#sajo1993role&quot;&gt;(Sajo, 1993)&lt;/a&gt;. He praised these humanities professionals as ideal wordsmiths (based on their work in expressing the inherently emotional message of Hungary’s social movements); and also as stewards of social mobility for upcoming classes (as they utilized their traditional law school training, as members of the ruling classes, and directed it towards the public service sector and local self-government works) &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#sajo1993role&quot;&gt;(Sajo, 1993)&lt;/a&gt;. Stability in society seemed to rise with the number of lawyers from various social backgrounds; &lt;em&gt;“judges were administratively replaced by semi-skilled new “loyal” judges of worker and peasant origin”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#sajo1993role&quot;&gt;(Sajo, 1993)&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, Sajo highlighted positive societal progress made possible through “elites”; one could infer that those lawyers satisfied a degree of their own need for self-actualization, as they truly internalized their roles of protecting the public’s “safety and security needs”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent history, one particularly notable work by Celia Brown-Blake, highlighted the interconnected nature of linguistics and law &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#brown_legal_change2014expanding&quot;&gt;(Brown-Blake, 2014)&lt;/a&gt;. Brown-Blake reviewed details of a Charter on Language Rights and Language Policy in the
Creole-speaking Caribbean stating that it may be a positive step, in a language-planning process that strived to “use the law as a tool to effect change in the language order of Caribbean Creole-speaking countries”, but also warned that it may only provide limited success without the proper recognition and enforcement of proposed changes &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#brown_legal_change2014expanding&quot;&gt;(Brown-Blake, 2014)&lt;/a&gt;. Brown-Blake’s work can serve as inspiration for creative problem-solving associated with linguistic barriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Caribbean can serve as a rich multilingual setting in which one can explore the relationship between law and linguistics. The 2006 case for Gerald Joseph’s criminal appeal, served to highlight the importance of proper linguistic consideration for clients that speak heritage languages (missing reference). The complexity of this environment allows for multiple law specialties for a local Saint Lucian and overseas markets; thus, increasing the possibility of encountering non-English speakers as clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Caribbean has had a complicated past of trade, colonization, slavery, indentured labor, and more recently voluntary immigration. This, therefore, leads to a present setting of an actively multilingual environment that is ever-changing due to evolving political and legal policies (such as Citizenship by Investment (CIP) &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#bayat_2020&quot;&gt;(Bayat &amp;amp; El Hachem, 2020; GIS, 2017; CIP, 2020; Capital, 2020; Harvey, 2020; Visa, 2016)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;English is the main language spoken (a prestige language) in Saint Lucia, however, Saint Lucian Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/Patios) is the heritage language of the island; there are several other languages officially taught (French and Spanish) and generally spoken in the close-knit Caribbean (such as Dutch, Portuguese, Hindi, Arabic, and even Japanese, Mandarin and increasingly Russian) &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#hillman2009understanding&quot;&gt;(Hillman &amp;amp; D’Agostino, 2009; “Saint Lucia,” n.d.; Kobayashi, 2020; Nesheim, 2020; CBF, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the Saint Lucian constitution does outline the nature of trials in the native language of the accused. As of 1979 constitution officially began enforcing the following linguistic provisions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Any person who is arrested or detained shall with reasonable promptitude and in any case no later than twenty-four hours after such arrest or detention be informed in a language that he understands of the reasons for his arrest or detention and be afforded reasonable facilities for private communication and consultation with a legal practitioner of his own choice and, in the case of a minor, with his parents or guardian.”&lt;/em&gt; It also specifically stated that &lt;em&gt;“every person who is charged with a criminal offence… shall be informed as soon as reasonably practicable, in a language that he understands and in detail, of the nature of the offence charged…” and “shall be permitted to have without payment the assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand the language used at the trial…”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#slu_1978&quot;&gt;(SLU, 1978)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the constitution is clear on what provisions to be made concerning the native language of the accused, however, it does not state how this standard is to be monitored or maintained or the level of fluency of the speakers. It appears that the accused is the one solely responsible for indicating if there are issues of miscommunication, rather than the courts maintaining such a standard. This lack of a formal monitoring system of the linguistic capabilities of lawyers on the island may lead to, at the very least, delays in justice when clients are seeking suitable legal representation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While legal aid, has become a reality for Saint Lucians within the last two decades, and court-appointed interpreter can be sought &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#SLU_legalaid_2015&quot;&gt;(Digital, 2015; Emmanuel, 2001; Satney, 2007)&lt;/a&gt;, the legal environment does have several areas for improvement &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#gaillard_SLULAW_2020&quot;&gt;(Gaillard, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;. The legal environment (and the general public) does not appear to prioritize effective language assistance services. To that, a 2002 “crime trends in the Caribbean and responses report”, suggested that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Broadly, crime control and prevention strategies may be designed to (a) systematically treat the root causes of crime (b) make populations more resilient to criminality (c) strengthen the ability of the responsible institutions to respond to crime in all of its various expressions. In the language of the public health officials, the first would represent a kind of primary prevention.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This perspective highlights issues within the law enforcement and practitioners, as they do not emphasize the exploration of language barriers as part of progress; the focus is often on “modernizing police-citizen relations” via updated techniques and technologies, rather than improving direct communication skills with civilians.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Douglas Midgett’s work on the anthropological linguistics of Saint Lucia, the island’s inhabitants have struggled in their appreciation of its heritage language &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#midgett1970bilingualism&quot;&gt;(Midgett, 1970)&lt;/a&gt;. Historically there were negative connotations with Saint Lucian Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/Patios), upon emancipation there was extreme enmity between English and Creole in the newly free society; the use was negatively equated “with all that is backward, rural, Negro, and unsophisticated” &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#midgett1970bilingualism&quot;&gt;(Midgett, 1970)&lt;/a&gt;. Nonetheless, as of May 1970, Midgett suggested that the vitality of the language was still strong; he stated that “there still exists a situation in which virtually every native-born St. Lucian can speak Patois” &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#midgett1970bilingualism&quot;&gt;(Midgett, 1970)&lt;/a&gt;. This language still appears to be surviving today, albeit under an inconclusive status; despite the recent surge in appeal due to governmental and pop culture support, the lingering lack of definitive vitality data could inadvertently permit an unabated decline &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#marmion2014community&quot;&gt;(Marmion et al., 2014; Midgett, 1970; Kabir, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, Midgett did, however, acknowledge that “English is the language of all national institutions… Patois is the language of folk institutions”; therefore, it is not surprising that some are still encouraged to learn and converse in English, rather than in Saint Lucian Kwéyòl, to appear more professional or polished &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#oas_2018&quot;&gt;(OAS, 2018)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, both Sajo and Brown-Blake investigated areas beyond simply practicing the law and drafting policies to foster necessary changes in society. One can therefore infer that while policies may boost linguistic equality and harmony in a multilingual society, proper enforcement of these policies and standards is crucial. It does, however, raise the question of the effectiveness of current monitoring practices, if there is no quantifiable tether to these ideals in the form of active data collection. Based on the aforementioned works of Sajo and Midgett, one can infer that to effectively raise the prestige of minority heritage or minority languages, their prevalence among the “elite” members of society, those that hold a great influence on society’s sense of safety and security, should be monitored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;monitoring-and-maintaining-linguistic-standards-in-lawyering&quot;&gt;Monitoring and maintaining linguistic standards in lawyering:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-noted-gap-in-demographic-data&quot;&gt;A noted gap in demographic data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although data collection on the various professions can be conducted by private companies, it is typically undertaken by government-backed labor agencies to ensure that the data is freely available to the public. While not all developing nations have been able to dedicate resources to the close monitoring of this data, its value is increasingly recognized. In America, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) collects such data and hosts it on a public website &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#BLS2020&quot;&gt;(BLS, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. BLS provides general information on the demographics of the lawyers in the country, however, the American Bar Association (ABA) gathers more detailed information on Legal Profession Statistics &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#BLS2020&quot;&gt;(BLS, 2020; ABA, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;. Their current statistical data is used to assist with research on lawyers and the legal profession. Their website notes data on the topics of lawyer demographics (including matters of disability, women, and minority/people of color) &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#aba_2020&quot;&gt;(ABA, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;. It also encompasses justice system statistics (including topics on public perception of justice system/lawyers and the justice system), court statistics (including cases filed, and criminal justice statistics) &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#aba_2020&quot;&gt;(ABA, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;. This association also notes the topics of law students and education and legal salaries (and related attrition/retention data) &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#aba_2020&quot;&gt;(ABA, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saint Lucia’s National Environmental Information System (NEIS) has been one of the latest governmental attempts at collecting and organizing national data &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#govtSLU_NEIS_2019&quot;&gt;(govt.lc, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#govtSLU_NEIS&quot;&gt;(neis.govt.lc, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#govtSLUdata&quot;&gt;(govt.lc, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;. This “Project Reporting System for Multilateral Environmental Agreement (MEA) Implementation and Environmental Information Management” is regarded as a “legal instrument with binding effects on countries that have agreed to become parties” &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#govtSLU_NEIS&quot;&gt;(neis.govt.lc, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;. Saint Lucia’s participation in this international agreement, enhances global agreements and sustainable development projects moving forward. However, one current category that highlights the “employed labor force by industry”, is classified as having a low priority level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, lawyer demographics in Saint Lucia (SLU) do not appear to be centrally gathered. The 2016 Labour Force Survey, made publicly available by The Central Statistical Office of SLU; while it inquired into one’s occupation status, job title, industry, business name, and type of work, the resulting response data appeared to be difficult to utilize &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#govtSLU_Labour_2019&quot;&gt;(govt.lc, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;. The form was very complex and detailed to the point where it was a bit detrimental; the form allowed for so many generalizations and customizations of categories such as job titles so that the resulting information seemed to be challenging to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the dataset ultimately appears to have been simplified to the point where details on individual professions were rendered indiscernible. The response most related to lawyers would be one that highlighted occupations that involved “professional, scientific and technical activities”; this made up 1.0% (51 participants) of the survey. A representative of The Central Statistical Office of SLU stated that the data in the country’s 2016 Labour Force Survey was “not disaggregated in such a way to get a count of all lawyers” &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#govtSLU_Labour_2019&quot;&gt;(govt.lc, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;. It was also stated that since the 2016 Labour Force Survey “utilizes a sample if it were to give a figure it would not be representative” &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#govtSLU_Labour_2019&quot;&gt;(govt.lc, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;. Ultimately, even the president of the Bar Association of SLU (Renee St. Rose), also confirmed that she was unaware of the departments of government bearing statistical data specific to lawyers &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#st.rose_information_2020&quot;&gt;(St.Rose, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-noted-gap-in-linguistic-legal-data&quot;&gt;A noted gap in linguistic legal data&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consideration of a country’s legal system’s ties to linguistics is not new, however, the topic has not been thoroughly explored (particularly in extensively multilingual and multicultural settings such as the Caribbean). Lawyering in a fairly multilingual setting can inherently be more challenging than lawyering in environments with very little linguistic diversity. However, operating in a country with a set prestige and active heritage language introduce additional challenges. One Caribbean academic did express the lack of study on crime and language in the region. In a 2020 interview, the aforementioned academic, Trinidadian linguist Jo-Anne Ferreira, stated &lt;em&gt;“crime was linked to lack of jobs, [which] is linked to lack of education, [which] is linked to lack of language access” thus, linking “crime and language”&lt;/em&gt;. She had no issues with English as the national official language of a country, however, she had strong concerns with the &lt;em&gt;“minoritizing of the majority and their language”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#mendes-franco_2020&quot;&gt;(Mendes-Franco, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;. She went on to state that &lt;em&gt;“bilingualism and multilingualism are normal around the world. The problem is we like to think of bilingualism as good only if it includes a language with status”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#mendes-franco_2020&quot;&gt;(Mendes-Franco, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite her passion for the topic, Ferreira’s focus appeared to be on the cumulative circumstances that led to criminals to the life of crime &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#mendes-franco_2020&quot;&gt;(Mendes-Franco, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;, and not necessarily at the justice system that may be failing to effectively intercede on the behalf of heritage language speakers. Surveying the details of the languages spoken by current prisoners would be a comprehensive study; however, surveying those current prisoners may be highly time-consuming and a wrapped up in ethical bureaucracy. Such a study would also focus on first addressing the needs of current prisoners, rather than actively addressing language needs before individuals become entangled in the complexities of the local legal system. It is fair to have concerns about possible disparities in the applications of laws based on one’s practice of a heritage language (Saint Lucian Kwéyòl), rather than the prestige language (English). However, examining the linguistic skills of lawyers practicing in a multilingual environment may provide some useful and timely information, from a less complex participant pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;studys-purpose&quot;&gt;Study’s Purpose:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assessing the link between crime and language.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reflection on Maslow’s need for safety and security during the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has highlighted gaps in data collection and monitoring various fields and industries in Saint Lucia. Unlike its North American counterpart, the Bar Association of Saint Lucia (and the local government) did not closely monitor the data of lawyers on the island. A need was, therefore, identified for obtaining detailed demographic data on lawyers. With many languages being spoken on the island, one does ponder the ease of communication between prestige and heritage language speakers, and whether it can impact one’s sense of safety and security; concerns about the effectiveness of legal defenses are warranted after the 2020 revelation of increasingly questionable behaviors among local lawyers &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#gaillard_SLULAW_2020&quot;&gt;(Gaillard, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;methodology&quot;&gt;Methodology:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;survey-environment-participants-and-instruments&quot;&gt;Survey environment: Participants and instruments&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project aims to conduct a non-experimental quantitative survey of lawyer demographic and linguistic data. The goal is to have as many lawyers participate as possible; therefore, determining the base total population of lawyers on the island is important to one gauging if the end participation levels meet sufficient statistical standards for the study to be considered viable. According to a 2020 public statement of the President of the Saint Lucia Bar Association (SLBA), there are just over 200 lawyers that practice in Saint Lucia &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#george_2020&quot;&gt;(George, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;. Direct communications with the president of the SLBA, revealed that while membership is not mandatory, all lawyers are considered members of the association (unless they expressly declare this is not to be the case) &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#st.rose_followup_2020&quot;&gt;(St.Rose, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;. It should be noted that a voluntary membership list on the SLBA website indicates that at least 64 members can be directly contacted via email by members of the public; however, the president of the SLBA has agreed to assist with the distribution of the survey by utilizing a private internal contact list of all members &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#st.rose_followup_2020&quot;&gt;(St.Rose, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An online survey was selected as the tool/instrument of data collection, to best adhere to social distancing protocols of the pandemic. A draft survey has been completed utilizing Google forms since there is no financial backing required for its launch; SurveyMonkey is a well-known online survey system, however, with a Basic (free) plan one can &lt;em&gt;“collect unlimited responses for free, but view either 40 or 100 responses per survey (depending on when you created an account and your billing location). Any responses over your account’s response limit are hidden, and will be deleted 60 days after they’re received”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#surveymonkey_2020&quot;&gt;(SurveyMonkey, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;. Since responses are estimated to be between 64 and 500, SurveyMonkey may not be the most financially efficient tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This survey does not currently offer any financial compensation to participants. Most censuses do not compensate respondents, as respondents may view participation as a basic civic duty. Furthermore, it noted that there is an additional extrinsic motivation to comply if the survey is administered by or on behalf of a government body, an industry, an association, or an educational institution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the need for compensation of participants for surveys and questionnaires is still a highly disputed matter in research fields. It can be argued that despite increasing the rate of participation, compensating participants does not guarantee their attention to detail and honesty. On the other hand, some may argue that non-compensation decreases participation numbers, and may not guarantee attention to detail; however, there is a higher likelihood of honest answers as motivation is fueled by sheer interest, and not clouded by monetary gain, but sheer interest. Overall, arguing for or against compensation is further complicated when administered in a setting that lacks detailed data/ has conducted limited data analysis of the people and the culture. The US is highly data-driven and has records going back centuries, whereas records in places such as the Caribbean, maybe non-existent, under-resourced, or even deliberately destroyed. One would be able to argue that compensation is necessary for inhabitants of the US, yet, it seems highly questionable to arrive at the same conclusion for a different (and understudied) culture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding data or studies to support compensation in countries or regions that are under-researched has proven challenging. However, Goldstein pointed to a work that seemed apt for this situation; that being Stecklov and co.’s work on “can incentives improve survey data quality in developing countries?” &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#stecklov2018can&quot;&gt;(Stecklov et al., 2018)&lt;/a&gt;. The difference between compensation and non-compensation was about 96 to 99.9 percent, respectively. Notably, the work observed that bias arose in compensated participants when questioned about assets, monthly income, and consumption of luxury expenditures (all being reported lower); thus, it appeared that the incentive group attempted appearing poorer than their actual situation to somehow justify the compensation they were receiving. Providing compensation also bears consideration of the possible negative impact of an overjustification effect in the context of a project on social good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, one’s culture may also impact survey participation and the need for compensation. Despite being a small island with a commensurate population, and newly independent (as of 1979), the inhabitants of Saint Lucia appear to have a heightened sense of community and social progress; Caribbean islands can be viewed as collectivist societies (albeit a forced outcome of colonialization). One can, therefore, infer that perhaps digital surveys that aim to improve their societies, through census type surveys of industries and professions, are even more likely to be favorably received in a collectivist setting (thus requiring no compensation) than in an individualistic setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, as noted before, the Central Statistical Office of SLU, acknowledges that their collection of data is highly limited and rarely done; the department is still developing resources and acquiring personnel, and, therefore, limitations to research are likely to be linked to data gatherers limited resources, rather than lack of responses from data givers. Moreover, since the survey stands to benefit their field, lawyers may be more inclined to answer honestly and paid attention to detail. Therefore, while compensation may become a necessary consideration for future surveys, voluntary participation in this socially beneficial project does not appear to necessitate compensation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the analysis will encompass initial exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and then evaluated with confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), with visualizations, and will include Chi-square tests of independence &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#luk2013bilingualism&quot;&gt;(Luk &amp;amp; Bialystok, 2013; Suhr, 2006)&lt;/a&gt;. Results will be run through both Python and R Studio; the best representations of the data will be selected. Additional analysis and tools may be applied where necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;survey-design-questions&quot;&gt;Survey Design: Questions&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://forms.gle/8yUuGYaCidMgbN5E8&quot;&gt;See draft survey (with consent form) here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be basic demographic data collection on Saint Lucian lawyers (questions 1- 8 below), and linguistic data collection on Saint Lucian lawyers (questions 9-17 below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;1. Please indicate your age from the following ranges.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Options: Less than 18; 18-24; 25-29 ;30-34; 35-39; 40-44; 45-49; 50-54; 55-59; 60-64; 65-69; 70-74; 75 or older; Choose not to respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The age range (multiple choice) was based on the ABA data that indicates lawyers typically obtain higher education levels beyond high-school and remain in practice past the age of 65 &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#ABA2020Profile&quot;&gt;(Association, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;; the median age of all U.S. workers was 42.3 years old, yet very few lawyers are younger than 25 and the median age for U.S. lawyers in 2019 was 47.5 years old. This question was posed as a standard demographic question, yet it was also important as it highlighted the current and future state of the legal linguistic environment. Noting age may highlight multilingualism trends among age groups. For example, if multilingualism is more prominent in the younger lawyers, then the projection of multilingual representation would be positive positive. However, if multilingual tendencies are clustered among older lawyers, then this study may serve to highlight needed points of improvement in the legal system in an increasingly multilingual society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;2. Please indicate which of the following classifications best describe (s) you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Options: Man; Woman; Choose not to respond; Other (please specify)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gender identification is another standard (multiple choice) demographic question, however, it is useful to gather this data check whether the August 2020 American trend of men outnumbering women (especially in leadership), is replicated in and persistent in the Caribbean country of Saint Lucia &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#ABA2020Profile&quot;&gt;(Association, 2020; Clio, 2020; Ernde, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;. There may also be a need to highlight if there are any differences in linguistics interests among the lawyers. Females are often believed to be more capable of and interested in linguistic acquisition and practice. Data gathered could confirm or dispute this assumption &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#van2015gender&quot;&gt;(Van Der Slik et al., 2015)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;3. Please indicate which of the following best describe (s) your ethnicity/race.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Options: Amerindian (Native Caribbean People)/American Indian/Alaska Native; Black/African/Afro-Caribbean; White/North European; Mediterranean (Greek, Italian, Turkish, Syrian, etc.); Hispanic/ Latino (Mexican, Central or South American, or other Spanish or Portuguese, etc.); Indian subcontinent; SE Asian/Chinese/Native Hawaiian/ Other Pacific Islander; Mixed parentage; Not known; Choose not to respond; Other:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the ABA noted that “most state bars and state licensing agencies do not track race and ethnicity in the profession”, in 2020 there was an increase in this type of data collection &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#ABA2020Profile&quot;&gt;(Association, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#clio_2020&quot;&gt;(Clio, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#AttorneyAtWork_2019&quot;&gt;(Ernde, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;. As of 2010, only 11.4% of all American lawyers were men and women of color, and this only rose to 14.1% in 2020 &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#ABA2020Profile&quot;&gt;(Association, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#clio_2020&quot;&gt;(Clio, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#AttorneyAtWork_2019&quot;&gt;(Ernde, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;. In developed countries, like America, it is said that minorities remain underrepresented in the legal profession; however, there is limited information on the legal environment of the Caribbean-an environment where the majority of the population would historically be non-white. As of the 2010 Saint Lucian census, the “ethnic group” of 
“African Descents” represented about 85.28 percent of the population (the highest); this was distantly followed by the “Mixed” category with 10.85 percent, and the “East Indian” at 2.16 percent &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#CSO_SLU2010&quot;&gt;(CSO, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, one’s household and upbringing may shape or influence one’s interests. Multiculturalism is quite prevalent in the Caribbean, however, one’s multilingualism might be impacted by one’s upbringing. While formal education may be a primary factor in one’s language acquisition, various states of immigration over generations, or other forms of diversity in one’s household, might influence their linguistic capacities.
Identifying participant ethnicity/race is another standard demographic inquiry, nevertheless, its inclusion is to highlight any differences in linguistics interests among the lawyers based on their backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;4. Please indicate the base of citizenship that best applies to you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Options: Jus sanguinis (right of blood); Jus soli (right of birthplace); Naturalization; Non-citizen; Choose not to respond&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question may be useful in establishing whether naturalized citizens are more likely to be multilingual than locally born persons (or persons with familial ties to the country. Legal terms were used to add a bit more clarification. This question is indeed problematic as it may be considered an identifiable trait in the survey, based on the limited number of lawyers on the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;5. Please indicate the number of years you have been in practice (number of years since your first call to the bar in the Common-Wealth etc.).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Options: Less than 1; 1-5; 6-10; 11-15; 16-20; 21-25; 26-30; 31 or more; Choose not to respond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a typical demographic question, however, it is one that can reveal data on the vibrancy or stagnancy of the field in terms of linguistics. It was an attempt to pinpoint how long one can thrive in an industry without the need for multilingual skills. It will be interesting to explore if career longevity is strongly or weakly associated with one’s linguistic acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;6. Please indicate the option (s) that best describes your current working environment.&lt;/em&gt;
Options: In private practice, in a firm with less than 5 lawyers; In private practice, in a firm with 5-15 lawyers; In private practice, in a firm with 16-25 lawyers; In private practice, in a firm with 26-50 lawyers; In private practice, in a firm with 51 or more lawyers; Public service (work with government agencies and officials, etc.); Public interest (legal aid, legal services, public defender, etc.); In a not for profit organization; In an academic institution; Choose not to respond; Other (please specify).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawyers may choose to focus on different areas of the law, and the clients they encounter are due to this specialization &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#umassamherst_general2020&quot;&gt;(Amherst, 2020; UMassAmherst, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;. Inquiring into one’s area of specialization will highlight which areas of the law may be associated with a need to speak multiple languages; more specifically, which areas of the law in Saint Lucia, are more likely to require an understanding of Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;7. Please indicate your areas of practice; please check all that apply.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specialty Options: Alternative dispute resolution (ADR), Banking and Finance law, Citizenship by investment, Commercial law, Constitutional law, Construction law, Contract law, Corporate law, Criminal law, Employment law, Environmental law, Equity and trusts, EU law*, Family law, Human rights law, Insurance law, Intellectual property (IP) law, Land law, Litigation, Media law, Private client law, Property law, Public law, Shipping law, Sports law, Tax law, Tort law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An additional means of narrowing down underlying multilinguistic tendencies in this field is to inquire into one’s areas of practice. St. Lucia is a sovereign island nation in the Commonwealth of Nations, but because Saint Lucia was both a French and English colony before it gained independence on February 22nd, 1979, the legal system has been a mix of civil and English common law (missing reference). This complexity allows for multiple law specialties for a local Saint Lucian market, as well as abroad; thusly, increasing the possibility of encountering non-English speakers as clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;8. Please indicate your average annual income.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Options: Below 36,000 XCD; 36,001 XCD - 46,000 XCD; 46,001 XCD - 56,000 XCD; 56,001 XCD - 66,000 XCD; 66,001 XCD - 76,000 XCD; 76,001 XCD - 86, 000 XCD; 86,001 XCD - 96, 000 XCD; 96,001 XCD - 106, 000 XCD; Above 106,001 XCD; Choose not to respond&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on one’s average salary per case, there could be an argument for the economic reinforcement of certain linguistic standards. It may be interesting to note if multilingual able to request and acquire more money due to their linguistic abilities. The Average Attorney Salary of a lawyer located in the sister island country of Dominica is around 2,950 XCD per month &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#DOMsalary&quot;&gt;(salaryexplorer.com, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;. It has been said that salaries range from 1,360 XCD (lowest) to 4,680 XCD (highest). Yet, according to salaryexplorer.com, a Saint Lucian Attorney typically earns around 5,500 XCD per month; this is with salaries ranging from 2,530 XCD (lowest) to 8,750 XCD (highest). It should be noted that Saint Lucia’s minimum wage rate was last changed at the beginning of 2013, yet it stands at XCD 300 a month for office clerks, XCD 200 for shop assistants, and XCD 160 for messengers according to minimum-wage.org &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#SLU2020wages&quot;&gt;(minimum-wage.org, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;9. Please indicate your current student debt level.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Options: None; Below 36,000 XCD; 36,001 XCD - 46,000 XCD; 46,001 XCD - 56,000 XCD; 56,001 XCD - 66,000 XCD; 66,001 XCD - 76,000 XCD; 76,001 XCD - 86, 000 XCD; 86,001 XCD - 96, 000 XCD; 96,001 XCD - 106, 000 XCD; Above 106,001 XCD; Choose not to respond&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consideration was given to the fact that student debt may be a confounding variable to multilingualism. For example, some individuals may be deterred from pursuing optional formal language courses as this may incur additional debt. To account for this variable a question concerning student debt was included. The inclusion is supported by the ABA, as it too gathers such data &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#aba_2020&quot;&gt;(ABA, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;; moreover, this data can also be utilized to better monitor the legal field like simply observing educational cost trends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;10. Please indicate if a perceived language barrier has ever limited any of your attorney-client interactions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Options: Yes; No; Choose not to respond&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question seeks to explore the personal linguistic limitations of lawyers in a multilingual environment, and if multilingual clients are having their needs met by the current environment. It may reveal if there have been any issues with legal representation on the island. If there are, the findings may reinforce the negative impact of a lack of multilingual lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;11. Please indicate if a perceived language barrier has ever limited any of your attorney-client interactions with Saint Lucian Kwéyòl speakers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Options: Yes; No; Choose not to respond&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question seeks to garner specific details on language barriers; it attempts to explore the boundaries of fluency that a lawyer may encounter specifically when attempting to represent local Saint Lucian Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/Patios) speaking clients. It is a heritage language and is said to be the second most spoken language on the island. Reduced language barriers would allow lawyers to better relay facts, arguments, and sentiments of clients with the distinct Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/Patios) speaking background. This may establish if there is or is not a need for lawyers to acquire that particular language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;12. Please indicate if your workplace offers any formal foreign language assistance programs to support linguistic diversity in clients.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Options: Yes, an internal service available to clients.; No, an external service would be recommended (for example, a court-appointed interpreter).; Choose not to respond&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question is to simply assess the resources available to lawyers provided by their workplaces. If there is a substantial foreign language assistance support system already in existence, this could also suggest that the industry has considered the connection of linguistics to the legal field and effectively addressed it. This question may be flawed since it could be one large firm that provides such language assistance services, rather than the entire industry; however, one could argue that based on a favorable overall total percentage of participation, this could still have a positive reflection on the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;13. If you do speak more than one language, please indicate if your multilingual skill was ever crucial to representing a client.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Options: I do not speak more than one language; Yes; No; Choose not to respond&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question seeks to investigate the demand for multilingualism in lawyering, based on experienced demand. These details may reveal sufficiencies as well as insufficiencies concerning the adequate legal representation of Saint Lucian clients. Saint Lucia is a multilingual country, and so a lawyer capable of speaking multiple languages would be better able to relay facts, arguments, and sentiments of clients with diverse backgrounds. Such lawyers, with reduced language barriers, would benefit from attracting a broader and more diverse client base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;14. Where applicable, please rank the languages you use most often to communicate within your household. This question only requires one response per row (ties in rankings can be indicated).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Column Titles: 1st language (most often used); 2nd language (second most often used); 3rd language (third most often used); N/A; Choose not to respond&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Row Titles: English; Saint Lucian Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/Patios); Haitian Creole; French; Spanish; Papiamento; Portuguese; Dutch; Hindi (or any Indian subcontinental language not listed); Arabic (or any Mediterranean language not listed); Swahili (or any African language not listed); Russian (or any Eurasian language not listed); Japanese; Mandarin; Any form of sign language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question is one of the most crucial to this study as this may signify a Saint Lucian lawyer’s mother tongue, or L1 &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#posel2016language&quot;&gt;(Posel &amp;amp; Zeller, 2016)&lt;/a&gt;. The ranking is necessary to note each language’s dominance  &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#uscb_2020&quot;&gt;(USCB, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;. To limit participant fatigue and simplify data analysis, the rank is limited to three main language options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While English is a prestige language in Saint Lucia &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#hilaire2008postcolonialism&quot;&gt;(Hilaire, 2008; Irvine, 2020; Midgett, 1970; St-Hilaire, 2011)&lt;/a&gt;, it is indeed a multilingual country. Therefore, assumptions cannot be made as to one’s full competencies of English; indeed one may have been hired based on being a native speaker of another language, or a variety of other scenarios. Yet, the form will only be presented in English; this is because a certain degree of its competency is required of professionals that practice in Saint Lucia (and most legal documents are indeed written in English).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, apart from modern English, legal (and medical) professionals can claim to be multilingual, based on their foundational studies of Latin. Latin has been declared a dead language, and its inclusion would indeed seem redundant, as the field already recognizes this knowledge. Questioning one’s fluency in Latin may also spark negative feelings from participants, as the language is intrinsically linked to the mastery of their profession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saint Lucian Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/Patios) is inquired about, as it is the heritage language of the island &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#midgett1970bilingualism&quot;&gt;(Midgett, 1970)&lt;/a&gt;. While a language vitality survey has not been conducted since 1946 &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#irvine2020language&quot;&gt;(Irvine, 2020; Hilaire, 2008; St-Hilaire, 2011)&lt;/a&gt;, most leading language authorities, including “Ethnologue”, assume that the language is not in a threatened or endangered state &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#irvine2020language&quot;&gt;(Irvine, 2020; Ethnologue, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;; the last records indicate that the majority of the Saint Lucian population are “bilingual in English and  &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#mitchell2009st&quot;&gt;(Mitchell, 2009)&lt;/a&gt;. It stands to reason that law practitioners on the island may have encountered or have had to represent speakers of this language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haitian Creole is another heritage language of the Caribbean, that has been recognized as the official language of Haiti via a constitutional change, and is currently being formally regulated by &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#macedo2019decolonizing&quot;&gt;(Macedo, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;. There has been a long legal struggle to have it fully recognized as part of the island’s standard education; especially on the island of Haiti &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#kuhn2019haiti&quot;&gt;(Kuhn, 2019; DeGraff, 2016; Brown-Blake, 2014)&lt;/a&gt;. There is evidence to support the fact that several legal professionals, from the Caribbean and abroad, have interacted with Haitian Creole speakers, particularly to assist with disaster relief services &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#lacet_haiti2012trauma&quot;&gt;(Lacet, 2012; O’Brien &amp;amp; Federici, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;. Haitian Creole was, therefore, added to reduce any possible confusion with the classification of Haitian Creole as Saint Lucian Kwéyòl. To further reduce confusion surrounding the creole languages of the Caribbean, Papiamento was acknowledged with a designated option &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#brown_legal_change2014expanding&quot;&gt;(Brown-Blake, 2014)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French and Spanish languages were included on this list as these are typical education offerings of all high schools on the island of Saint Lucia &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#irvine2020language&quot;&gt;(Irvine, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;. These languages reflect the general Caribbean environment, as several countries recognize and teach French and Spanish as their prestige languages; this includes countries such as Martinique and Guadeloupe, and Cuba, respectively. Dutch, Portuguese, and to a lesser extent Hindi (or any other Indian subcontinental language), are other common languages to the rest of the Caribbean due to colonialization and indentured labor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;African, Arabic, and other immigrants from the Mediterranean region do have a strong presence in the Saint Lucian business environment, and therefore, may have needed for legal representation on the island &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#hillman2009understanding&quot;&gt;(Hillman &amp;amp; D’Agostino, 2009; “Saint Lucia,” n.d.; Posel &amp;amp; Zeller, 2016)&lt;/a&gt;. Japanese is taught in Saint Lucia by humanitarian volunteers as part of their Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) work &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#kobayashi_2020&quot;&gt;(Kobayashi, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;. Due to an increased presence of Chinese investors and tourists in the Caribbean, and general funding of local projects by China, one’s ability to understand Mandarin is becoming increasingly valuable &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#rstc_Pearl2019&quot;&gt;(RSTC, 2019; Reynolds, n.d.)&lt;/a&gt;. Once again these immigrants may have had needed legal representation on the island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that Saint Lucia has established a system for CIP &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#bayat_2020&quot;&gt;(Bayat &amp;amp; El Hachem, 2020; GIS, 2017; CIP, 2020; Capital, 2020; Harvey, 2020; Visa, 2016)&lt;/a&gt;. Local lawyers that practice in this area have a greater probability of interacting with persons from various parts of the world; particularly interacting with persons from areas that had no prior historic (colonial) immigration or language ties to the country. Persons from Russia, Asia, and the Middle East have been noted as having increasingly high rates of interest in the CIP programs of the Caribbean &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#nesheim_CIP_2020&quot;&gt;(Nesheim, 2020; CBF, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;. The creation of the additional categories, including any form of sign language, was developed to best encapsulate as many interaction scenarios as possible &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#parks_williams_Signlang2011&quot;&gt;(Parks &amp;amp; Williams, 2011; Posel &amp;amp; Zeller, 2016)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;15. Please indicate your proficiency in speaking, reading, writing, and or listening (understanding) the following languages. This question requires at least one response per row. Note: Selecting only “listening (understanding)” encompasses scenarios where one can comprehend but not converse in a language.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Column Titles: Speak; Write; Read; Listen (Understand); N/A; Choose not to respond&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Row Titles: English; Saint Lucian Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/Patios); Haitian Creole; French; Spanish; Papiamento; Portuguese; Dutch; Hindi (or any Indian subcontinental language not listed); Arabic (or any Mediterranean language not listed); Swahili (or any African language not listed); Russian (or any Eurasian language not listed); Japanese; Mandarin; Any form of sign language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question is related to determining linguistic proficiency. Row titles will remain the same based on the aforementioned logic on the participant pool. The column category “Listen (Understand)” was added to account for the possible occurrence of asymmetrical bilingualism, receptive bilingualism, non-accommodating bilingualism, among lawyers in the Caribbean &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#thomas2018degree&quot;&gt;(Thomas-Sunesson et al., 2018; Luk &amp;amp; Bialystok, 2013; Woolard, 2004; Bilaniuk, 2010)&lt;/a&gt;. This consideration is valid as multilingualism is prevalent in this region; persons here may encounter various languages, yet have been unable to effectively respond. The presence of a prestige language, such as English, may draw speakers away from heritage languages; these heritage languages can suffer from dropping numbers of speakers when the identification of receptive bilingualism is not followed up with focused efforts. However, I am also currently considering proficiency column items of  “don’t speak or understand; understand some and speak none; understand some and speak some; understand well and speak some; understand well and speak fluently; N/A” &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#marmion2014community&quot;&gt;(Marmion et al., 2014)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;16. Please indicate your level of fluency in the languages listed below. This question requires only one response per row.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Column Titles: Highly fluent; Fluent; Some mastery; A little mastery; Not at all; Choose not to respond&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Row Titles: English; Saint Lucian Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/Patios); Haitian Creole; French; Spanish; Papiamento; Portuguese; Dutch; Any form of sign language; Hindi (or any Indian subcontinental language not listed); Any form of sign language; Arabic (or any Mediterranean language not listed); Swahili (or any African language not listed); Russian (or any Eurasian language not listed); Japanese; Mandarin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This question is related to determining linguistic fluency. Row titles will remain the same based on the aforementioned logic on the participant pool. Rankings of “Highly fluent; Fluent; Some mastery; A little mastery; Not” at all were selected as a simple means of classifying fluency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;17. Please indicate which technique best describes how you came to learn each of the following languages. This question requires at least one response per row.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Column Titles: Formal education (requirement); Formal education (elective); Informal education (hobby); Informal education (from family &amp;amp; friends); N/A (I do not use this language); Choose not to respond&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Row Titles: English; Saint Lucian Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/Patios); Haitian Creole; French; Spanish; Papiamento; Portuguese; Dutch; Any form of sign language; Hindi (or any Indian subcontinental language not listed); Any form of sign language; Arabic (or any Mediterranean language not listed); Swahili (or any African language not listed); Russian (or any Eurasian language not listed); Japanese; Mandarin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding where and how one engages in language learning might highlight environments that foster multilingualism in lawyers. The learning of certain languages may take place in formal and informal settings. In Saint Lucia, it is highly likely that most language education would be done in a formal school setting. Overall, the national heritage language of this island would typically be learned informally &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#carrington1988creole&quot;&gt;(Carrington, 1988; Charlemange, 2017; UNESCO, 2017)&lt;/a&gt;. Saint Lucian Kwéyòl only recently began being formally taught to young children (between the ages of 6-12) in less than a handful of schools or during the observation of cultural celebrations &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#oas_2018&quot;&gt;(OAS, 2018; Anthony, 2017)&lt;/a&gt; and paid private sessions for adult learners. However, since the major fire at the National Folk Resource Center, most classes, if offered at all, have reverted to more private sessions &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#slu_news_online_2019&quot;&gt;(Online, 2019; DBS, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;. Formal Kwéyòl course offerings from a Saint Lucian higher education institution during 2020, failed to materialize &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#salcc_2020&quot;&gt;(SALCC, 2020)&lt;/a&gt;. Row titles will remain the same based on the aforementioned logic on the participant pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;18. Please indicate which language frequency category best reflects your typical client interactions. This question only requires one response per row.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Column Titles: Very Frequently; Frequently; Occasionally; Rarely; Very Rarely; Never; Choose not to respond&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Row Titles: English; Saint Lucian Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/Patios); Haitian Creole; French; Spanish; Papiamento; Portuguese; Dutch; Any form of sign language; Hindi (or any Indian subcontinental language not listed); Any form of sign language; Arabic (or any Mediterranean language not listed); Swahili (or any African language not listed); Russian (or any Eurasian language not listed); Japanese; Mandarin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since this survey is unable to acquire data from past clients, this question serves to address the languages that lawyers commonly encounter. The language one typically speaks is not guaranteed to be a client’s mother tongue. It will be interesting to note where the client and lawyer languages overlap, and where they do not; this question may detect possible deficiencies in language assistance resources within this field. Row titles will remain the same based on the aforementioned logic on the participant pool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;future-studies&quot;&gt;Future studies:&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, such a survey can be applied to various underdeveloped legal environments; potential survey pools can include the legal associations of other developing countries or regional associations (such as the Caribbean Bar Association ) &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#cba_2012&quot;&gt;(CBA, 2012)&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, other occupations around Saint Lucia can be targeted as potential survey pools; they could produce a better understanding of language assistance services island-wide. Health care workers, fire departments, and even law enforcement services such as police officers and security services may benefit from the data provided by such a study; any profession that requires direct extended interaction with citizens, when providing a sense of safety and security, may benefit from such studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional (possibly future) studies may include an investigation into the existence of inmate metrics; particularly linguistic data. This would encompass an investigation of the rates of incarceration of predominantly Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language speakers. Further investigation could be conducted on linguistics, crime, and domicile data; criminal household location data (per district), paired with linguistic data could dispel or reinforce one popular belief that most Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language speakers are located in the Southern part of the country (and therefore are more unruly and prone to crime) &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#carrington1988creole&quot;&gt;(Carrington, 1988)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;safety-and-security-needs-can-be-explored-as-topics-related-to-assets&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Safety and security needs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; can be explored as topics related to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assets&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a time of crisis, such as the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, Maslow’s theory of needs aids in visualizing and prioritizing scarce resources based on an individual’s needs &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#maslow_1943_2000&quot;&gt;(Maslow, 1943; Mcleod, 2020; Matias et al., 2020; Casale &amp;amp; Flett, 2020; Wong et al., 2020)&lt;/a&gt;. Often, obtaining our needs is intrinsically linked to the ease with which we are able to communicate - our ability to understand and to be understood. To effectively facilitate the communication of various societal needs, data science can be employed as a means of monitoring and maintaining the standards of numerous fields through the careful study of an environment’s linguistics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, our sense of safety and security can be linked to the ease with which we can understand the medical advice being relayed to us by medical professionals or their ability to understand the symptoms we describe. As recently as 2019, Sweden conducted a national study on health care professionals’ communications through interpreters; an investigation occurred after noting that many parents utilizing neonatal care were foreign-born and unable to effectively communicate with the healthcare professionals in the local language, &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#patriksson2019health&quot;&gt;(Patriksson et al., 2019)&lt;/a&gt;.  In 2013, linguistic one work highlighted communications issues between physicians and Spanish-speaking Latin American women with pelvic floor disorders &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#sevilla2013communication&quot;&gt;(Sevilla et al., 2013)&lt;/a&gt;. This study highlighted that apart from patients’ lack of understanding concerning the disease, there was a lack of Spanish proficiency among the participating physicians. Even in 2009, there was a study done on competent peer support intervention for Spanish-speaking Latinas with breast cancer &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#napoles2009developing&quot;&gt;(Nápoles-Springer et al., 2009)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, one of the areas most closely associated with ensuring societal safety and security would be a country’s legal system. This system encompasses police officers and high courts, however, the position of utmost importance in navigating the legal system on an individual’s behalf - one’s voice in the court - would be their lawyer. Therefore, the effectiveness of communication between lawyers and the client can be fundamentally linked to that client’s freedom. Data science can therefore be used as a means of monitoring and maintaining justice through the exploration of legal data; trends may be uncovered on the probability of innocent or guilty verdicts, given the lawyer’s capacity to communicate in the client’s dominant language (mother tongue).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the Caribbean can serve as a rich multilingual setting in which one can explore the relationship between law and linguistics. The 2006 case for Gerald Joseph’s criminal appeal, served to highlight the importance of proper linguistic consideration for clients that speak heritage languages (missing reference), do these cases occur most often require Family law, Land law, Property law, Environmental law, or perhaps Employment law, Human rights law, and even Criminal law. Based on the verdict of cases, it may also be possible to predict the likelihood of one winning a case where one’s language limitations are part of their legal defense. Where possible, additional demographic data may be highlighted to provide additional parameters for the calculation of the likelihood of success or failure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Considerations may need to be made as to the setting of the cases. Should the case be considered a success or a failure if the defendant is the creole speaker? What happens if the plaintiff is the speaker and wins? What happens if the plaintiff is the speaker and loses? What happens when both are creole speakers? Were court-appointed interpreters used?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional complications may include the fact that there are various types of creole in the Caribbean. Some are French-based like Haitian Creole and Antillean Kwéyòl (Saint Lucian and Dominican). Others may be English-based; this may include Jamaican and Barbadian (but may also include a Saint Lucian variant &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#irvine2020st&quot;&gt;(Irvine, 2020; Hilaire, 2008; St-Hilaire, 2011)&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, Papiamento or Papiamentu, a Portuguese-based creole language, is also present in the Caribbean; however, it is mostly restricted to the Dutch Caribbean/ ABC islands, having official status in Aruba and Curaçao, and is a recognized language in the Dutch public bodies of Bonaire, Sint-Eustatius and Saba).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis will begin with cases in the Caribbean region (as this is a highly multilingual setting) from the database of www.eccourts.org; if the data is insufficient parameters will be widened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will need to settle on a model once sufficient data has been identified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After testing the necessary preliminary analysis is conducted, documents will be developed, finalized, and shopped around to the various related journals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This document may be paired with the industry multilinguistic competency survey of Saint Lucian lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What can an LIWC Sentiment analysis on Maslow's works reveal?</title>
   <link href="http://llord1.github.io/2020/07/08/Sentiment"/>
   <updated>2020-07-08T00:00:00-04:00</updated>

   <content type="html">
&lt;h2 id=&quot;brief-introduction&quot;&gt;Brief introduction:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his 1943 paper for Psychological Review, &lt;em&gt;A Theory of Human Motivation&lt;/em&gt;, Abraham Maslow promoted a visual representation of his psychological theory. The model, dubbed as Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, was a tiered hierarchy of human needs; it was a motivational theory in psychology. The five-tiered version of this hierarchy has been widely used in various fields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This framework, however, is mostly utilized in business settings. Some leaders might consider this theory when planning project productivity goals, while most leaders turn to this theory to investigate and explain why productivity goals were not met. Here, negative connections can be drawn to the framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exploring Maslow’s existing works with the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) tool, might provide more insight into how his framework is applied. If his works are more negative than positive, this may assist in surmising why leaders employ his structure as a tool that categorizes employee problems, rather than individuals utilizing it as an inspirational and aspirational structure. Despite Maslow’s hierarchy being well-known in business environments, leaders may seldom employ this model to assess themselves and their personal goals. Moreover, businesses are more likely to create employee surveys based on this framework than directly educate employees on the framework’s possible application to their individual lives, and how their productivity in the workplace is impacted by it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hypothesis&quot;&gt;Hypothesis:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Maslow’s works are more negative than positive in tone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;topics-to-be-discussed&quot;&gt;Topics to be discussed:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What can an LIWC Sentiment analysis on Maslow’s works reveal about the overall tone of his contributions?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Is the tone of his work being misinterpreted as innately negative?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Which psychological processes best illustrate his works?&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Should it be assumed that the “affective processes” of negative and positive be the only areas for exploration, or should other areas be explored?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Can his work be best assessed as focusing on “personal concerns” like work, leisure, home, money, and religion; or by “drives” of affliction achievement, power, reward, and risk? Perhaps the sexual and ingestion “biological processes” are his true focus, or the “social processes” topics of family, friends, female references, and male references.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Can the LIWC’s psychological processes be categorized into the structure of Maslow’s psychological needs, or would there be areas of overlap?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Can a visual mapping be created to display this interaction?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;additional-liwc-capabilities&quot;&gt;Additional LIWC capabilities:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are all the psychological needs quantifiably equal when paired with their relative psychological processes?  For example, does the score of “belonging and love”  within the lens of the “biological process” match “social processes”’s?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Are all levels of the hierarchy equally discussed, or are do they vary based on their position in the structure and their topic matter? For example, is the topic of “physiological needs” going share the same word count as “self-actualization”? Do they have the same “analytical thinking” score?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Or do these “psychological needs” demonstrate a score reflective of their position in the structure.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;More reading is required on the LIWC. Since both the LIWC and Maslow’s hierarchy utilize similar terminology associated with psychological needs/ processes, was its creation influenced by Maslow? If so, what was the extent?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Assets: Impact of tourism on Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language vitality</title>

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What impact, if any, does tourism have on the vitality of the Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language? What factors elevated the prestige language on over the heritage language? For example, are tourists likely to move freely throughout all communities, or just certain ones based on the number of tourist attractions or ease of transportation (based on infrastructure)? Consequently, vendors of those communities may frequently defer to the prestige language when engaging in tourists due to the positive reinforcement associated with a successful sale. Also, are educational facilities of impressionable youths located near tourist hubs?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study would entail observing data on various areas of interest related to tourism in Saint Lucia. For example, examining data on the number of tourist attractions per district, number of hotels per district,  the ports of entry per district, number of jobs related to tourism per district, number of educational facilities per district, and the number of main government offices per district. The final details may lead to a discussion of language hotspots; and a possible explanation of their existence.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Assessing the link between crime and language. Could miscommunication between prestige and heritage language speakers hinder legal defenses? Are there any metrics on lawyers’ multilingual lawyers on the island? Are there any laws related to representation requirements (do lawyers assess the language needs of clients to decide how best to assist them)? What are the rates of incarceration of predominantly Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language speakers? What are the inmate metrics per district of origin (there is a popular belief that most Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language speakers are located in the Southern part of the country)?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What language learning tools are most effective with acquiring Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language? A comparison of specially curated Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language of Language learning tools: discussion of the value of puzzles for language acquisition and familiarity (word search puzzles), discussion of curated mnemonic tools, and language learning mobile applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pursuit of language learning is one done with the hopes of improving communication; to understand and to be understood. It should be acknowledged that languages consist of text data, albeit well-established corpora. Often language teachers are challenged with the task exploring such corpora and finding creating ways simplifying inherently complex language concepts. This undertaking is often done with the aid of some visual aids; however, the standards of visualizations vary as teachers are often expected to create unique learning tools to explain standard course material to each new class.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language teachers are encouraged to keep their visualization of the age-old corpora fresh. Moreover, they are increasingly expected to incorporate technology into their works where possible. However, the application of the latest forms of technology is not always suitable; at times, simplicity is indeed the best option. Therefore, the goal here is to investigate the established forms of data visualization when teaching languages and attempt to rank them. Ranking can assist with forming future recommendations for the teaching of specific topics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spanish is one of the most popular languages spoken in the world and taught in schools; it is also one listed as one of the more simple languages to acquire as a second language. In fact, while the Kwéyòl, the heritage language of Saint Lucia, is taught in only a handful of schools on the island, Spanish is one of the main languages commonly taught in most high schools. Since the learning of Spanish is so common, investigations seeking the simplification of complex linguistic concepts could ease language acquisition, and indirectly enhance communications in society. Data visualization could improve how individuals can absorb this language information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the teaching and learning of Spanish verbs can be difficult. In Spanish, most verbs can be classified based on their endings of AR, ER, and AR. Conjugating the verbs requires an understanding of concepts such as regular and irregular endings. Verbs may also be classified based on the “stem change” involved in conjugation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, verbs are typically taught using simple tables. Even if one were to focus on stem-changing verbs, tables are indeed the most common form of displaying the information. While not very visually interesting, this is the standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llord1/llord1.github.io/master/resources/pictures/palm.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;Hellloererererer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other teachers may attempt to make this information more visually appealing by displaying images of these personal groupings, and then adding their related labels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llord1/llord1.github.io/master/resources/pictures/palm.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;Hellloererererer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some teachers have unofficially adopted the “shoe/boot verbs method” to visualize verb conjugation. Another less popular method in the US is the “hand method”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llord1/llord1.github.io/master/resources/pictures/palm.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;Hellloererererer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This form assigns persons to fingers on one’s hand. This method is reminiscent of the Guidonian hand mnemonic device, that had been used to aid singers in studying to sight-sing. This form, however, excludes the second-person-plural version of verbs - the vosotros form. This form is not necessarily difficult to learn, only novel to many persons that learned Spanish in the Americas; when looking at spanish being acquired in Latin America versus Spain, the use of vosotros can mean the difference between being formally correct or informally fluent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llord1/llord1.github.io/master/resources/pictures/palm.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;Hellloererererer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has recently been suggested this hand mnemonic device, can be adapted to include all the verb conjugation details. The vosotros form can be acknowledged as special rather than being ignored; this uniqueness can be highlighted through its association with the ring finger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llord1/llord1.github.io/master/resources/pictures/palm.PNG&quot; alt=&quot;Hellloererererer&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;transcendence-needs-can-be-explored-as-topics-related-to-altruism&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Transcendence needs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; can be explored as topics related to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Altruism&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An online creole dictionary resource has been provided by SIL(Summer Institute of Linguistics) International Publications, however, it is incomplete. Many words are missing altogether, and some present words bearing multiple meanings (many of which are not stated).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there an existing model for implementing community discussion of dictionaries?  Is it possible to create an infrastructure for community collaboration of an endangered language?
Is it possible to explore the implementation of an online dictionary resource through a systems dynamic model? And would other models be more applicable (for example, the application of the predator-prey Lotka-Volterra model,  or the WORLD3 Model)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online dictionaries allow users and compilers opportunities far beyond those of traditional publishing constructions. For an endangered language, the use of such a resource becoming increasingly essential. However, the use of static online dictionaries may not be sufficient to meet the demands of language that is slowly dying. Static dictionaries with dynamic qualities may better serve the needs of cataloging an endangered language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online dictionaries can benefit from using technology to update their records regularly. This not only pertains to new sections of the alphabet but “also with words of particular interest to its users at the time”. Words such as LOL and YOLO were online slangs that were added to the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) in 2011, and 2016 respectively. The third edition of the OED appears to no longer suppress widely‑used slang terms, however, it certainly is incapable of documenting the meaning and use of every fleeting term used among small assortments of speakers within the entirety of English‑speaking world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Urban Dictionary is the free service of an online dictionary of contemporary English slang usage; it is a “collaborative project of over 1 million definitions for over 400,000 unique headwords”. It serves as an online lexicography where public contributors explain the meanings of words and phrases not readily covered by traditional dictionaries; contributors collaborate, cooperate, and compete for meaning-making. Eventually, depending on the proliferation of use in society, official dictionaries, such as OED, may elect to officially adopt a word from such a collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collaborative compilation of online lexicography is, therefore, known to linguistics. In fact, there is a webpage, similar to Urban Dictionary, that strategically caters to Caribbean consumers. While the region bears various peoples with differing histories, they do share similarities. Most of these similarities, however, are the unfortunate result of colonialization from similar superpowers, certain words are ubiquitous due to the ease of traversing and settling in neighboring countries. Persons of these areas experience similar flora and fauna, and environmental and social phenomena that are endemic to their setting and way of life. The website, Wiwords, is a dynamic online dictionary that highlights instances of shared vocabulary, as well as allowing for contributions that are unique to certain countries in the Caribbean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should, however, be noted that Saint Lucians do not appear to be highly active in this online linguistic community. For example, there are no contributions to the section outlined for local “quotes” or sayings, when these are quite abundant in the local language. Most participation from Saint Lucia pertains to discussions of food, and animal and plant life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the Antillean creole spoken in Saint Lucia can benefit from utilizing online language resources. A pidgin is language variety developed by speakers in contact who share no common language; it would have limited functions of use, is linguistically simplified, and has developed its own rules and norms of usage. Creole languages are developed from pidgins, and severe as the first language of some members of a speech community, where it is used for a wide range of functions. Since creole languages seldomly achieve official status, the speakers of a fully formed creole may eventually feel compelled to conform their speech to one of the parent languages. This decreolization process typically brings about a post-creole speech continuum characterized by large scale variation and hypercorrection in the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore, to better preserve the creole language within Saint Lucia,  a dynamic online community dictionary would be very useful in keeping certain words active. However, there are flaws in this structure that can be improved upon. Public contributors may understand the language in terms of speaking it, however, they may not be the best teachers; that is to say that contributors may not always be clear in their explanations or contributions. Overall, straying from official spellings of words can contribute to data entry issues. For example, one can observe the accents used with “chofé” - “to heat up”,  and “chofè” - a “driver”. These words without context and accents would be very difficult to decipher. Persons being inaccurately applying accents, or unable to access the necessary unique characters were required (diacritics) for formal grammar can present problems in documenting the language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another issue with dictionary compilation in this region may deal with the overlap of meanings attributed to certain words. Many-to one-relations between words and their meanings (e.g. homonymy and polysemy) are often not included in lists when studying this grammatical phenomenon for a unique language like creole. In addition to synonyms, frequent polysemy, the presence of homonyms and homophones and the phenomena sometimes referred to as the “false friends” of the translator.
Dictionaries recognize the distinction between polysemy and
homonymy by making a polysemous item a single dictionary entry
and making homophonous lexemes two or more separate entries; polysemous terms can though different can be derived from one basic idea, and the related terms reflect that image.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polysemy is a common occurrence in the endangered language of Saint Lucian Antillean creole. An indication of a polysemous verb in English is one that corresponds to different verbs when translated into other languages. For example, one can review the English word for “ask” (for information) and “ask” (for action); this can be interpreted as one word “vragen” in Dutch, however, the majority of other languages use different words for each interpretation in English, like “fragen” and “bitten” in German, and “preguntar” and “pedir” in Spanish. In Saint Lucian creole,  this can be seen where the term “mwen” can mean “me” or “my”, or the term “asou” can mean “on” or “lean against”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the word, “Creole” can be viewed as a contested, polysemous term in the English language. The term has been used at different times and in various geographical regions to describe distinct identities, languages, peoples, ethnicities, racial heritages, and cultural artefacts. As an adjective, Creole was applied as an indicator of higher status bestowed upon Louisiana-born slaves to distinguish them from those born in African. It was also used as a noun to designate local birth in Louisiana, regardless of racial heritage; later Creole was used by Americans when referring to people of Spanish or French descent, yet it has often been conflated with the term “Cajan” (which described French colonists that settled in Canada’s Acadia region, then migrated to Louisiana). In fact, for some time, there was also a misconception that the term only referred to whites born in Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, Creole primarily refers to one’s linguistic heritage (French culture and a unique Franco-linguistic dialect) as the main source of their ethnic identity (particularly those of mixed or foreign ancestry). Creole, ‘Kreyol’ or ‘Kweyol’ also refers to the creole languages in the Caribbean, including Antillean Creole, Haitian Creole, and Jamaican Creole, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polysemy may indeed present an issue for when attempting to study a language or dialects, however, it is in fact, the premise of much of the active literature in this language. Calypso, and most other endemic forms of music, may celebrate this ability to utilize words or phrases bearing double meanings to indirectly discuss topics that are often crude. Philips suggested that Calypsos can engage this method via ‘lamina lyrics’. &lt;em&gt;Much like an onion, these Calypsos have a number of different levels of meaning, concealed one underneath the other. Achieving this phenomenon, Calypsonians use frames and masks that manifest in Calypsos as a metaphor, metonym, polysemy, irony, and satire&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1863, August Schleicher, the German linguist, discussed languages as &lt;em&gt;natural organisms that come into being, develop, age, and die according to laws that are quite independent of man’s will&lt;/em&gt; (cited by Arens 1969:259). This perception of language is contrary to recent the modern view that it is one’s set of communication habits that have principally been defined by their social experience, led by an innate sense to decipher and learn the language practices of others. However, despite having a few members of “native speaking generation” left, often communities lack the implementation of structures dedicated to the retention of language. Therefore, successive generations may require resources that express the necessity of the language as well as its desirability to ensure its continuance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mohan is of the view that living languages can die before “the last trace of memory has vanished”; that these languages may be experiencing a feigned guise of life through its observation of “sympathetic post-users from outside its system” (1979:42). To further quote Mohan, there are two senses in which an obsolescent language becomes dead before its forms have completely disappeared:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A small part of the non-native speaking generation has preserved dead tokens of the language. Also, the time gap between the age of the youngest native speaker and the latest possible age of language acquisition, in infancy, shows the language dead at its source, but with a now finite community of native speakers continuing, like the earlier light of a dead star, to travel its original course and give an illusion picture of vitality. (313)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover,  Sasse (2001) lists ten changes occurring during language obsolescence;  several of which bear similarities to those described by Campbell &amp;amp; Muntzel (1989) and Palosaari &amp;amp; Campbell (2011), namely: &lt;em&gt;loss of phonological distinctions, regularization of morphophonemics, loss of function words, analyticity, loss of morphology, loss of syntactic complexity, agrammatism, phonological and grammatical variability, reduction of vocabulary, and an increase in polysemy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Evaluating and creating structures is crucial for the preservation and promotion of endangered languages.
&lt;strong&gt;Need to expand on the definition of systems dynamic model and other models here…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perceptions of the locals’ attitudes towards the creole language are often complicated. Language change in Saint Lucia has been a pressing concern for academics for many years. As recent as 1970,  Douglas Midgett highlighted that the formal teaching of Patois would be viewed as “unjustifiable and in any case, would never be tolerated by even its most ardent user”. At the time, he noted that most people agreed that increased proficiency in spoken and written English (or French) would be an educational must, however, writers and other academics and actual educators had differing views; the former group believed that use of creole in schools could aid with recognizing English as a second language, whereas educators adamantly argued against any use of Creoles in the schools. He believed that the use of Patois in the schools interchangeably with less formal, more colloquial English would aid in establishing English in the minds of students as a functional Patois equivalent. He suggested that as long as educational institutions reinforce the conventional traditional opinion of separating the two languages, the campaign for English literacy and spoken usage will not have widespread effectiveness. Midgett, however, underestimated how pervasive the English language would be; in fact, it is the creole language that currently lacks proper literacy among the public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1998, Frank explored and even expanded the written form of the creole language in Saint Lucia while attempting to effectively translate an English bible into the local language. Upon concluding his tasks he remarked that the bible would indirectly boost creole literacy through the motivational passages of the bible:
 &lt;em&gt;“… for all practical purposes Creole remains an unwritten language for the majority of the population, which remains unaware of the books published in Creole. Attempts to teach Creole literacy have not met with much success because of lack of interest. Motivation is the most important factor in the success of any literacy program, and having something people want to read is the most important motivating factor”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This ultimately leaves one to wonder if it is logical and possible to merge an official online static dictionary with a dynamic slang dictionary to increase fluency of an endangered language? Such as system would require access to an existing dictionary, as well as opportunities for dictionary contributions. The creation of an interactive dictionary may assist with reinvigorating the usage of the language through active use and contributions to this resource, but also offer opportunities to actively discuss and clarify words and concepts associated with creole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How effective has the vocabulary of Indian origin been in its contribution to St. Lucian Creole Vocabulary? Are the words strictly isolated to food, and a few racial descriptors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hypothesis&quot;&gt;Hypothesis:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vocabulary of Indian origin are present in low rates and strictly isolated to food and racial descriptors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;null-hypothesis&quot;&gt;Null hypothesis:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vocabulary of Indian origin has no effect on beyond food and racial descriptors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;commentary&quot;&gt;Commentary:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only relevant literature on this topic thus far is a statement on one of SIL’s reports :
“Vocabulary of Indian Origin. Most of the few words in St. Lucian Creole of Indian origin have to do with cuisine: dal (Hindi), dalpouri, goulgoula, gwodja, kirou, kòri (Tamil), mango (Tamil), roti (Hindi), sohari and talkari. There are also two words, kouli [&amp;lt; Hindi qūlī ‘hired servant’] and dogla [&amp;lt; Hindi dogalaa ‘hybrid’], that have to do with ethnicity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;http://www.saintluciancreole.dbfrank.net/workpapers/sources_of_vocabulary.pdf&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One may find data to support this experiment as Trinidad has a high Indian population of creole speakers, and Antillean creole shares some vocabulary (can check Wiwords for similarities).&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Jekyll Introduction</title>
   <link href="http://llord1.github.io/lessons/2011/12/29/jekyll-introduction"/>
   <updated>2011-12-29T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>http://llord1.github.io/lessons/2011/12/29/jekyll-introduction</id>
   <content type="html">
&lt;p&gt;This Jekyll introduction will outline specifically  what Jekyll is and why you would want to use it.
Directly following the intro we’ll learn exactly &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; Jekyll does what it does.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-jekyll&quot;&gt;What is Jekyll?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is a parsing engine bundled as a ruby gem used to build static websites from
dynamic components such as templates, partials, liquid code, markdown, etc. Jekyll is known as “a simple, blog aware, static site generator”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;examples&quot;&gt;Examples&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This website is created with Jekyll. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Sites&quot;&gt;Other Jekyll websites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-does-jekyll-do&quot;&gt;What does Jekyll Do?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is a ruby gem you install on your local system.
Once there you can call &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll --server&lt;/code&gt; on a directory and provided that directory
is setup in a way jekyll expects, it will do magic stuff like parse markdown/textile files,
compute categories, tags, permalinks, and construct your pages from layout templates and partials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once parsed, Jekyll stores the result in a self-contained static &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_site&lt;/code&gt; folder.
The intention here is that you can serve all contents in this folder statically from a plain static web-server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can think of Jekyll as a normalish dynamic blog but rather than parsing content, templates, and tags
on each request, Jekyll does this once &lt;em&gt;beforehand&lt;/em&gt; and caches the &lt;em&gt;entire website&lt;/em&gt; in a folder for serving statically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jekyll-is-not-blogging-software&quot;&gt;Jekyll is Not Blogging Software&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jekyll is a parsing engine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll does not come with any content nor does it have any templates or design elements.
This is a common source of confusion when getting started.
Jekyll does not come with anything you actually use or see on your website - you have to make it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-should-i-care&quot;&gt;Why Should I Care?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll is very minimalistic and very efficient.
The most important thing to realize about Jekyll is that it creates a static representation of your website requiring only a static web-server.
Traditional dynamic blogs like Wordpress require a database and server-side code.
Heavily trafficked dynamic blogs must employ a caching layer that ultimately performs the same job Jekyll sets out to do; serve static content.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore if you like to keep things simple and you prefer the command-line over an admin panel UI then give Jekyll a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Developers like Jekyll because we can write content like we write code:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ability to write content in markdown or textile in your favorite text-editor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ability to write and preview your content via localhost.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No internet connection required.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ability to publish via git.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ability to host your blog on a static web-server.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ability to host freely on GitHub Pages.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No database required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-jekyll-works&quot;&gt;How Jekyll Works&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following is a complete but concise outline of exactly how Jekyll works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be aware that core concepts are introduced in rapid succession without code examples.
This information is not intended to specifically teach you how to do anything, rather it
is intended to give you the &lt;em&gt;full picture&lt;/em&gt; relative to what is going on in Jekyll-world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning these core concepts should help you avoid common frustrations and ultimately
help you better understand the code examples contained throughout Jekyll-Bootstrap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;initial-setup&quot;&gt;Initial Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&quot;/index.html#start-now&quot;&gt;installing jekyll&lt;/a&gt; you’ll need to format your website directory in a way jekyll expects.
Jekyll-bootstrap conveniently provides the base directory format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-jekyll-application-base-format&quot;&gt;The Jekyll Application Base Format&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll expects your website directory to be laid out like so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;.
|-- _config.yml
|-- _includes
|-- _layouts
|   |-- default.html
|   |-- post.html
|-- _posts
|   |-- 2011-10-25-open-source-is-good.markdown
|   |-- 2011-04-26-hello-world.markdown
|-- _site
|-- index.html
|-- assets
    |-- css
        |-- style.css
    |-- javascripts
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_config.yml&lt;/strong&gt;
  Stores configuration data.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_includes&lt;/strong&gt;
  This folder is for partial views.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_layouts&lt;/strong&gt;
  This folder is for the main templates your content will be inserted into.
  You can have different layouts for different pages or page sections.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_posts&lt;/strong&gt;
  This folder contains your dynamic content/posts.
  the naming format is required to be &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@YEAR-MONTH-DATE-title.MARKUP@&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_site&lt;/strong&gt;
  This is where the generated site will be placed once Jekyll is done transforming it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;assets&lt;/strong&gt;
  This folder is not part of the standard jekyll structure.
  The assets folder represents &lt;em&gt;any generic&lt;/em&gt; folder you happen to create in your root directory.
  Directories and files not properly formatted for jekyll will be left untouched for you to serve normally.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jekyll-configuration&quot;&gt;Jekyll Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll supports various configuration options that are fully outlined here:
(&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Configuration&quot;&gt;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Configuration&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;content-in-jekyll&quot;&gt;Content in Jekyll&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content in Jekyll is either a post or a page.
These content “objects” get inserted into one or more templates to build the final output for its respective static-page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;posts-and-pages&quot;&gt;Posts and Pages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both posts and pages should be written in markdown, textile, or HTML and may also contain Liquid templating syntax.
Both posts and pages can have meta-data assigned on a per-page basis such as title, url path, as well as arbitrary custom meta-data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;working-with-posts&quot;&gt;Working With Posts&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating a Post&lt;/strong&gt;
Posts are created by properly formatting a file and placing it the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formatting&lt;/strong&gt;
A post must have a valid filename in the form &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR-MONTH-DATE-title.MARKUP&lt;/code&gt; and be placed in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory.
If the data format is invalid Jekyll will not recognize the file as a post. The date and title are automatically parsed from the filename of the post file.
Additionally, each file must have &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/YAML-Front-Matter&quot;&gt;YAML Front-Matter&lt;/a&gt; prepended to its content.
YAML Front-Matter is a valid YAML syntax specifying meta-data for the given file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Order&lt;/strong&gt;
Ordering is an important part of Jekyll but it is hard to specify a custom ordering strategy.
Only reverse chronological and chronological ordering is supported in Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the date is hard-coded into the filename format, to change the order, you must change the dates in the filenames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tags&lt;/strong&gt;
Posts can have tags associated with them as part of their meta-data.
Tags may be placed on posts by providing them in the post’s YAML front matter.
You have access to the post-specific tags in the templates. These tags also get added to the sitewide collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Categories&lt;/strong&gt;
Posts may be categorized by providing one or more categories in the YAML front matter.
Categories offer more significance over tags in that they can be reflected in the URL path to the given post.
Note categories in Jekyll work in a specific way.
If you define more than one category you are defining a category hierarchy “set”.
Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;---
title :  Hello World
categories : [lessons, beginner]
---
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This defines the category hierarchy “lessons/beginner”. Note this is &lt;em&gt;one category&lt;/em&gt; node in Jekyll.
You won’t find “lessons” and “beginner” as two separate categories unless you define them elsewhere as singular categories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;working-with-pages&quot;&gt;Working With Pages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating a Page&lt;/strong&gt;
Pages are created by properly formatting a file and placing it anywhere in the root directory or subdirectories that do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; start with an underscore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formatting&lt;/strong&gt;
In order to register as a Jekyll page the file must contain &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/YAML-Front-Matter&quot;&gt;YAML Front-Matter&lt;/a&gt;.
Registering a page means 1) that Jekyll will process the page and 2) that the page object will be available in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;site.pages&lt;/code&gt; array for inclusion into your templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Categories and Tags&lt;/strong&gt;
Pages do not compute categories nor tags so defining them will have no effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sub-Directories&lt;/strong&gt;
If pages are defined in sub-directories, the path to the page will be reflected in the url.
Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;.
|-- people
    |-- bob
        |-- essay.html
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This page will be available at &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;http://yourdomain.com/people/bob/essay.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended Pages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;index.html&lt;/strong&gt;
You will always want to define the root index.html page as this will display on your root URL.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;404.html&lt;/strong&gt;
Create a root 404.html page and GitHub Pages will serve it as your 404 response.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;sitemap.html&lt;/strong&gt;
Generating a sitemap is good practice for SEO.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;about.html&lt;/strong&gt;
A nice about page is easy to do and gives the human perspective to your website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;templates-in-jekyll&quot;&gt;Templates in Jekyll&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Templates are used to contain a page’s or post’s content.
All templates have access to a global site object variable: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;site&lt;/code&gt; as well as a page object variable: &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;page&lt;/code&gt;.
The site variable holds all accessible content and metadata relative to the site.
The page variable holds accessible data for the given page or post being rendered at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a Template&lt;/strong&gt;
Templates are created by properly formatting a file and placing it in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_layouts&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Formatting&lt;/strong&gt;
Templates should be coded in HTML and contain YAML Front Matter.
All templates can contain Liquid code to work with your site’s data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rending Page/Post Content in a Template&lt;/strong&gt;
There is a special variable in all templates named : &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;content&lt;/code&gt;.
The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;content&lt;/code&gt; variable holds the page/post content including any sub-template content previously defined.
Render the content variable wherever you want your main content to be injected into your template:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;...
&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div id=&quot;sidebar&quot;&amp;gt; ... &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;div id=&quot;main&quot;&amp;gt;
    &amp;#123;{content}&amp;#125;
  &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;sub-templates&quot;&gt;Sub-Templates&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sub-templates are exactly templates with the only difference being they
define another “root” layout/template within their YAML Front Matter.
This essentially means a template will render inside of another template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;includes&quot;&gt;Includes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Jekyll you can define include files by placing them in the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_includes&lt;/code&gt; folder.
Includes are NOT templates, rather they are just code snippets that get included into templates.
In this way, you can treat the code inside includes as if it was native to the parent template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any valid template code may be used in includes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-liquid-for-templating&quot;&gt;Using Liquid for Templating&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Templating is perhaps the most confusing and frustrating part of Jekyll.
This is mainly due to the fact that Jekyll templates must use the Liquid Templating Language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-is-liquid&quot;&gt;What is Liquid?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Shopify/liquid&quot;&gt;Liquid&lt;/a&gt; is a secure templating language developed by &lt;a href=&quot;http://shopify.com&quot;&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt;.
Liquid is designed for end-users to be able to execute logic within template files
without imposing any security risk on the hosting server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll uses Liquid to generate the post content within the final page layout structure and as the primary interface for working with
your site and post/page data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;why-do-we-have-to-use-liquid&quot;&gt;Why Do We Have to Use Liquid?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GitHub uses Jekyll to power &lt;a href=&quot;http://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;.
GitHub cannot afford to run arbitrary code on their servers so they lock developers down via Liquid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;liquid-is-not-programmer-friendly&quot;&gt;Liquid is Not Programmer-Friendly.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The short story is liquid is not real code and its not intended to execute real code.
The point being you can’t do jackshit in liquid that hasn’t been allowed explicitly by the implementation.
What’s more you can only access data-structures that have been explicitly passed to the template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Jekyll’s case it is not possible to alter what is passed to Liquid without hacking the gem or running custom plugins.
Both of which cannot be supported by GitHub Pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a programmer - this is very frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But rather than look a gift horse in the mouth we are going to
suck it up and view it as an opportunity to work around limitations and adopt client-side solutions when possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aside&lt;/strong&gt;
My personal stance is to not invest time trying to hack liquid. It’s really unnecessary
&lt;em&gt;from a programmer’s&lt;/em&gt; perspective. That is to say if you have the ability to run custom plugins (i.e. run arbitrary ruby code)
you are better off sticking with ruby. Toward that end I’ve built &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/plusjade/mustache-with-jekyll&quot;&gt;Mustache-with-Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;static-assets&quot;&gt;Static Assets&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static assets are any file in the root or non-underscored subfolders that are not pages.
That is they have no valid YAML Front Matter and are thus not treated as Jekyll Pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static assets should be used for images, css, and javascript files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-jekyll-parses-files&quot;&gt;How Jekyll Parses Files&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember Jekyll is a processing engine. There are two main types of parsing in Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content parsing.&lt;/strong&gt;
  This is done with textile or markdown.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Template parsing.&lt;/strong&gt;
This is done with the liquid templating language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thus there are two main types of file formats needed for this parsing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post and Page files.&lt;/strong&gt;
All content in Jekyll is either a post or a page so valid posts and pages are parsed with markdown or textile.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Template files.&lt;/strong&gt;
  These files go in &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_layouts&lt;/code&gt; folder and contain your blogs &lt;strong&gt;templates&lt;/strong&gt;. They should be made in HTML with the help of Liquid syntax.
  Since include files are simply injected into templates they are essentially parsed as if they were native to the template.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arbitrary files and folders.&lt;/strong&gt;
Files that &lt;em&gt;are not&lt;/em&gt; valid pages are treated as static content and pass through
Jekyll untouched and reside on your blog in the exact structure and format they originally existed in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;formatting-files-for-parsing&quot;&gt;Formatting Files for Parsing.&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve outlined the need for valid formatting using &lt;strong&gt;YAML Front Matter&lt;/strong&gt;.
Templates, posts, and pages all need to provide valid YAML Front Matter even if the Matter is empty.
This is the only way Jekyll knows you want the file processed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;YAML Front Matter must be prepended to the top of template/post/page files:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;---
layout: post
category : pages
tags : [how-to, jekyll]
---

... contents ...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three hyphens on a new line start the Front-Matter block and three hyphens on a new line end the block.
The data inside the block must be valid YAML.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Configuration parameters for YAML Front-Matter is outlined here:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/YAML-Front-Matter&quot;&gt;A comprehensive explanation of YAML Front Matter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;defining-layouts-for-posts-and-templates-parsing&quot;&gt;Defining Layouts for Posts and Templates Parsing.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;layout&lt;/code&gt; parameter in the YAML Front Matter defines the template file for which the given post or template should be injected into.
If a template file specifies its own layout, it is effectively being used as a &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sub-template.&lt;/code&gt;
That is to say loading a post file into a template file that refers to another template file with work in the way you’d expect; as a nested sub-template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-jekyll-generates-the-final-static-files&quot;&gt;How Jekyll Generates the Final Static Files.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Jekyll’s job is to generate a static representation of your website.
The following is an outline of how that’s done:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jekyll collects data.&lt;/strong&gt;
  Jekyll scans the posts directory and collects all posts files as post objects. It then scans the layout assets and collects those and finally scans other directories in search of pages.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jekyll computes data.&lt;/strong&gt;
  Jekyll takes these objects, computes metadata (permalinks, tags, categories, titles, dates) from them and constructs one
  big &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;site&lt;/code&gt; object that holds all the posts, pages, layouts, and respective metadata.
  At this stage your site is one big computed ruby object.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jekyll liquifies posts and templates.&lt;/strong&gt;
  Next jekyll loops through each post file and converts (through markdown or textile) and &lt;strong&gt;liquifies&lt;/strong&gt; the post inside of its respective layout(s).
  Once the post is parsed and liquified inside the the proper layout structure, the layout itself is “liquified”.
 &lt;strong&gt;Liquification&lt;/strong&gt; is defined as follows: Jekyll initiates a Liquid template, and passes a simpler hash representation of the ruby site object as well as a simpler
  hash representation of the ruby post object. These simplified data structures are what you have access to in the templates.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jekyll generates output.&lt;/strong&gt;
 Finally the liquid templates are “rendered”, thereby processing any liquid syntax provided in the templates
 and saving the final, static representation of the file.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes.&lt;/strong&gt;
Because Jekyll computes the entire site in one fell swoop, each template is given access to
a global &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;site&lt;/code&gt; hash that contains useful data. It is this data that you’ll iterate through and format
using the Liquid tags and filters in order to render it onto a given page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember, in Jekyll you are an end-user. Your API has only two components:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The manner in which you setup your directory.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The liquid syntax and variables passed into the liquid templates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the data objects available to you in the templates via Liquid are outlined in the &lt;strong&gt;API Section&lt;/strong&gt; of Jekyll-Bootstrap.
You can also read the original documentation here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Template-Data&quot;&gt;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Template-Data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this paints a clearer picture of what Jekyll is doing and why it works the way it does.
As noted, our main programming constraint is the fact that our API is limited to what is accessible via Liquid and Liquid only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll-bootstrap is intended to provide helper methods and strategies aimed at making it more intuitive and easier to work with Jekyll =)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thank you&lt;/strong&gt; for reading this far.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">
&lt;h2 id=&quot;musings-on-capitonyms&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Musings on Capitonyms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently, I have been feeling a bit more confident in my data science field knowledge, as I have been able to pick up on applications of field concepts in the tools that I and other items in my immediate environment. I now look at Grammarly and wonder about the underlying tools and infrastructure. I think about Noam Chomsky’s ideas on the “autonomy of syntax”, where syntax and grammar depict information that is independent of the meaning and semantics of words,  and how that may impact autocorrection here. It seems to have some sort of an interactive spelling correction, with an interesting combination of background lemmatization, tokenization, and PoS tagging; Grammarly probably has some “named entity recognition”, with “sentence boundary detection”, and a “Word Sense Disambiguation” feature using some kind of Lesk algorithm and snowball stemmer and (like those present in Python’s NLTK). Concepts like the editing of stopwords are not applied here, and it is not yet capable of properly handling corrections for various languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;te-quiero-yo-te-quiero&quot;&gt;Te quiero/ Yo te quiero:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also noticed that some phrases do not trigger error alerts in Grammarly. It appears that it does allow for Spanish phrases to be addressed as correct or incorrect, on an assumingly English platform. Sometimes it flags a Spanish word as incorrect simply because the word is not capitalized. For example, one can look at the Spanish phrase ‘te quiero’, which is the informal, way of saying ‘I love you’ (when compared to the more romantic phrase ‘te amo’). Grammarly currently suggests that one’ capitalizes only word quiero, to make the phrase acceptable/ remove the grammar alert (‘te Quiero’).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word ‘quiero’ is indeed a tricky one as it can be arrived at through conjugation, based on different scenarios. It can be derived from the reciprocal verb ‘Quererse’, where it can mean ‘to feel affection for’ (to love each other). It can also be derived from the transitive verb ‘Querer’; however, in a transitive form (where it demands things), it also has several slightly different meanings; it can mean ‘to feel affection’ which includes ‘to love’, ‘to like’, and ‘to be fond of’; it can also indicate intention (‘to mean’ and ‘to try’), or to wish (‘to want’). I will, however, state that the fact that quiero can be applied to so many different scenarios, can serve to support an argument for it being a demonstration of polysemy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, this issue with Grammarly is indeed due to quiero’s typical usage; it typically indicates a want. For example, one can want an item, like ice-cream; ‘Quiero helado’ translates to ‘I want ice-cream’. Here Quiero’s use is viewed as correct, yet instead, heldo is marked here as non-English. I suppose the Spanish phrase for “want ice-cream” may not be as popular/common, and one could say that this may have been a flaw with the original training data; however, I am uninformed of the underlying  structure, so I am unable to state if is completely based on machine learning models (or combined with a supporting language-translation tool) where quiero would have been typically encountered at the beginning of a sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, GoogleTranslate and Python’s Textblob library may also be a bit faulty as it seems that they offer varied capitalizations or meanings when a word or phrase is hyphenated, separate, or concatenated &lt;a class=&quot;citation&quot; href=&quot;#sarkar2019text&quot;&gt;(Sarkar, 2019; Sarkar, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;. When using GoogleTranslate from English to Spanish, to indicate that I want ice cream (with the words ice and cream separated) there are no capitalizations. However, if I hyphenate or concatenate, it capitalizes the word “Quiero”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This translation issue might also be due to the distinction between direct and indirect objects is not quite the same in Spanish, as it is in English; and thus the pronouns that represent them are sometimes called accusative and dative pronouns, respectively. Or it could be that the verb, Querer,  is considered to be a transitive verb (one that needs to have a direct object) and, therefore its usage is a bit more complex, thus difficult to program? Anyway, since the language is so temperamental does that mean that larger training datasets are needed in order to detect the nuance of the appropriate use or translation, or is this something a language package update/ new package could address?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;current-example-of-machine-translation-issues-in-action&quot;&gt;Current example of machine translation issues in action:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, in the last week, the singer Jennifer Lopez had a controversial Spanish line in her latest song that caused an interesting look into the NLP capitonym challenges. She called herself “Tu negrita del Bronx”. Negrita as you can probably guess can imply that something is dark, and “ita” is usually added to the end of something to indicate a term of endearment, infantilizing, or insulting to a dark-skinned person. People were unsure of what she meant by its use since she is clearly not dark in skin tone, but she tried to explain that in some parts of the Spanish world, calling someone dark-skinned is universal- basically, saying anyone who is not white is dark, and they do uplift each other for this quality. So confused fans went to Google for a literal translation, only to encounter further confusion; if you capitalized Bronx, it would display the negative version (your n-word from the Bronx), and if you did not capitalize it would have translated to the milder version ( “Your black girl from the bronx”).  Textblob also has the same translation result for both scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, that capitonym also appears to be used in Textblob to a certain extent; it appeared to be a means to address the differentiation between formal forms and informal forms of conversations.
The formal form of ‘yo te quiero’ and the informal from ‘te quiero’  result in ‘I love you’ and  ‘i love u’,  respectively. Note that regardless of capitalization in the formal phrase, the result is capitalized.  Yet only when the first character is capitalized in the informal (‘Te quiero’), will it be reciprocated in the result (‘I love u’); yet, the other words remain in their informal forms (‘you’ remains as ‘u’). An additional consideration is that when the word ‘mucho’ accompanies the phrase ‘te quiero’ to form ‘te quiero mucho’ (‘I love you very much’)  it seems to be regarded as formal, as all the necessary formatting is present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be interesting to see if translation changes over time to directly address this concern as the scandal would have generated additional internet chatter. It does not appear that Google is addressing this matter based on a live training dataset but perhaps based on a package like Textblob. Using keywords like “capitonym” “te quiero” “textblob”, I was unable to find any current literature on this occurrence via any Google or present in any scholarly archives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, I guess would love to do some sort of commentary paper on this phenomenon; to perhaps discuss the possible inner workings of the underlying algorithm that furthered the scandal, and discuss the possible future implications. Since world leaders are increasing their use of informal text and speech through the use of social media platforms, yet these same governments rely on this technology for translation, there could be potential future conflicts due to literal misinterpretation. Perhaps data science studies can raise the alarm for a need for improvement in the underlying flawed structure that lacks live updating to formal and informal dictionaries or demonstrates overfit models. That paper would have gone under my Maslow’s needs sections on belonging or security, since miscommunication can facture one’s sense of belonging, and subsequently lead to a lack of sense of security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am currently reading a work called &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://tinyurl.com/yyu3fxl2&quot;&gt;‘The definite article in Spanish as a polysemous category’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; since it was published in the Journal of Cognitive Science as if 2017; however, I acknowledge this is just for personal edification since this is more along the realms of Cognitive Linguistics and not pure Data Science. I am also reading &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/7492&quot;&gt;‘Linguistic-based evaluation criteria to identify statistical machine translation errors’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; since I am interested in statistical machine translation errors.&lt;/p&gt;
