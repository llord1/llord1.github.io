### Introduction:

The importance of language diversity and vitality in society was recently highlighted in the observance of the 2021 International Mother Language Day. The theme for this annual UNESCO celebration (typically held on February 21st) was “Fostering Multilingualism for Inclusion in Education And Society” {% cite joseph_2021 %}. It focused on the significance of an 'individual’s first language, indigenous language, native language emphasizing that instruction of such languages should begin in the early years". This theme was said to be the impetus for further development of the Saint Lucian Nation Language Policy, and can also support efforts to monitor, preserve, and examine this language {% cite joseph_2021 %}. 

Therefore, I am currently attempting to utilize surveys and data science tools to investigate and establish foundational truths about the linguistic environment in Saint Lucia, with particular attention to the vitality status of the local heritage language of Saint Lucian Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/ Patios/ Patwa). These surveys will be executed with close consideration of the articles present in the 'Charter on Language Policy and Language Rights in the Creole-Speaking Caribbean' {% cite icclr_2011 harris_2011 pousada2011linguists %}. Conducting a series of surveys will not only aid my educational pursuits but will also serve to bolster the execution of the upcoming Saint Lucian national language policy {% cite camdu_st_lucia_national_2021 camdu_2018 edu_ministry_2017 satney_2021 harris_2011 mini_edu_2021 joseph_2021 %}. This survey will focus on the crucial providers of education in Saint Lucia. 


### Goals:

This undertaking will finally enact Carrington's wishes from 1999 {% cite Carrington1999 %} - the creation of quantifiable data on the current status of the language, by investigating its usage among some of the most crucial members of Saint Lucia's labor force. The work of teachers, medical workers, lawyers, and law enforcement, are valuable to this study as they are respected pillars of society whose tasks typically require frequent interaction with the Saint Lucian public. It is hoped that this quantifiable data will aid in allocating teaching and learning language resources to these crucial members of society; perhaps the subsequent association of Kwéyòl with these respected professions will assist in its recognition and elevation{% cite hutchinson_1998 %}. I am inclined to believe that connecting Kwéyòl with elite members of society may be yet another necessary step towards recognizing it as an official language of Saint Lucia. 

As of September 2021, the Ministry of Education, Sustainable Development, Innovation, Science, Technology and Vocational Training hosted an online National Language Policy Implementation Planning Conference through the Curriculum and Materials Development Unit (CAMDU) {% cite satney_2021 camdu_st_lucia_national_2021 %}. The updated policy was stated to have four main goals for Kwéyòl; to recognize it as an official language, to utilize it as a language of instruction, that all students should become bilingual upon primary school completion, and that students will become bi-literate upon secondary school completion {% cite joseph_2021 %}.

Notably, during the conference, Professor Hubert Devonish provided an impassioned discussion on the difference between national language policy and an education language policy, and also highlighted the importance of 'The Charter on Language Policy and Language Rights in the Creole-speaking Caribbean'. Professor Hazel Simmons-McDonald Evidence-Basedementing Kwéyòl Instruction' using 'Evidence Based Approaches'; she noted that integrating Kwéyòl in the classroom may assist with improving student's ability to grab crucial concepts and that observing teachers' Kwéyòl competency levels may support this effort.

Ultimately, the goal of the current National Language Policy would be to ensure full literacy in Kwéyòl ”. It was reported that CAMDU Specialists, working on a language policy for the teaching of the Kwéyòl language in schools on the island, are hoping to have the completed implementation plan and already formulated draft policy presented to the Government of Saint Lucia by January of 2022 {% cite satney_2021 %}. Mention was made the ongoing works to survey crucial members of society and their roles in the linguistic environment of Saint Lucia {% cite language_survey_mention_2021 satney_2021 %}. 

Thus far, all of these attempts have been pivotal yet incremental steps towards raising the status of the Kwéyòl language. Unfortunately, it has yet to become recognized as an official language of the country, nor is it recognized by most modern translation systems. Language death can be associated with language shifts where an ethnic group's members no longer learn their heritage language as their first language; these surveys are at the very least are geared towards determining if Kwéyòl is still being used as a first language on the island {% cite maffi2002endangered edwards2003language tonkin2003language%}. Overall, these past efforts highlight the crucial need to quantify, monitor, and digitize the language to effectively preserve it for future generations.
