#### __Implications for the Field of Study__

To summarize, I will publish my foundational works in the form of survey reports on the subject language of this NLP dissertation. My major works will be published and noted as chapters one through four (with the inclusion of a publication of the complied language data of the dissertation).

My dissertation has involved foundational surveys as means of creating unique quantifiable data on the environment in which the rest of my works are based. These explore the status of a sample subject language through studying various critical members of a society's labor force. The work of teachers, medical workers (in the realms of both physical and mental health), lawyers, and law enforcement, typically encompasses frequent interactions with people of varying backgrounds in that environment. My upcoming works focus on *avoiding* miscarriages of justice due to miscommunication by conducting linguistic surveys to find the current multilingual capacities of authority figures. The work will simultaneously bolster the vitality (and recognition) of Kwéyòl, by encouraging mandatory education and monitoring of the local heritage language in critical institutions.

Yes, indeed this appears to mostly allow for benefits to sociolinguistics, however, there are indeed data science field benefits to studying low resource languages such as creoles. Ultimately, in addition to publishing survey results and other papers, I also hope to publish my collection of complied Kwéyòl language samples. I am indeed collecting multilingual corpora for a low-resource language as part of my ongoing dissertation work. I believe this would be a unique submission as I would compiling all these far-flung works of differing semantic domains and converting them from their various publication formats into analyzable text files. The bulk of work regarding computational linguistics will be published in academic journals.
