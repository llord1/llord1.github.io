#### __Implications for the Field of Study__


The publication process can be viewed as an essential part of one's Ph.D. solidification in the field. While publications before graduation from a program can at times be difficult, it may be advantageous to attempt this as part of one's ultimate success in the field. A publication plan allows one to market their results to places that are more apt to appreciate one's works; this allows one to ensure that their contributions are better recognized by industry professionals. Some have viewed such publications as providing a powerful and significant indicator for 'scientific career advancement' {% cite giebel_2019 %}; this is particularly important in a highly competitive field.

To summarize, I will publish my foundational works in the form of survey reports on the subject language of this NLP dissertation. My major works will be published and noted as chapters one through four (with the inclusion of a publication of the complied language data of the dissertation).

My dissertation has involved foundational surveys as means of creating unique quantifiable data on the environment in which the rest of my works are based. These explore the status of a sample subject language through studying various critical members of a society's labor force. The work of teachers, medical workers (in the realms of both physical and mental health), lawyers, and law enforcement, typically encompasses frequent interactions with people of varying backgrounds in that environment. The surveys will be conducted on as many of these professions as possible, before December 2021. These surveys have been slated for distribution while I continue to complete my other major coded/ data model papers. 

The 2021 publication of Dr. Sandra Evans in Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages, ‘Ou ni right-la pou remain silans’ The case for a standard Kwéyòl translation of the pre-trial right to silence', supports the academic merit of conducting surveys on language and law enforcement in Saint Lucia. That publication is right in line with a similar foundational survey within this dissertation that focuses on linguistics and the justice system in Saint Lucia. More specifically, this was a linguistic survey of the current multilingual capacities of the island's lawyers, in an effort to assess legal language services with the hopes of avoiding miscarriages of justice due to miscommunication between lawyers and clients. Interested entities such as the Bar Association of Saint Lucia, The Central Statistical Office of Saint Lucia, and the Saint Lucia Folk Research Center, are currently awaiting the results of this IRB-approved work.

I also have an upcoming law enforcement survey. It will focus on law enforcement as they (like lawyers) are all employed in critical services that require effective communication in an increasingly multilingual setting. Dr. Sandra Evans paper appears to have focused on the potential for miscarriages of justice due to miscommunication {% cite evans2021ni %}. My upcoming works focus on *avoiding* miscarriages of justice due to miscommunication. The work will simultaneously bolster the vitality (and recognition) of Kwéyòl, by encouraging mandatory education and monitoring of the local heritage language in critical institutions.

Ultimately, it is hoped that the results of these surveys will be published in the *Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages (JPCL)* {% cite benjamins.com_2021 %}. While there are other linguistic journals available, this one seems to be the best aligned with my subject matter; it appears to accept various linguistic works including sociolinguistics, and computational linguistics. However, the Society for Caribbean Linguistics (SCL) will serve as an additional possible publisher of all facets of the work being conducted in this dissertation, via its SCL Occasional Papers (OP) Series, and the SCL Popular Papers (PP) Series. {% cite scl_2021 scl_2021pub %}.

The bulk of work regarding coding will be published in other academic journals. For example, my main target is a recently created publication geared towards data science papers - *Patterns*. It is said to publish

*'...original research in data science, particularly focusing on solutions to the cross-disciplinary problems that all researchers face when dealing with data, and articles about datasets, software code, algorithms, infrastructures, etc., with permanent links to these research outputs'. Patterns also promotes cross-community conversation by publishing opinion pieces and review articles* {% cite patterns_2020 %}. Since I do intend to discuss matters related to computational linguistics, frameworks, and my dissertation's societal value to low-resource languages (biocultural diversity topics), I do believe that this is an appropriate target. 

However, this does not mean that other publishers will be ignored; I am also open to suggestions and changes concerning this matter. For example, the Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI) is a publisher of open access scientific journals. Additionally, I have recently become aware of Easychair; it claims to support "a large number of conference models and, judging by our Web traffic, is the world's largest conference management system" {% cite easychair2021 %}. 

Ultimately, in addition to publishing survey results and other papers, I also hope to publish my collection of complied Kwéyòl language samples. I am indeed collecting multilingual corpora for a low-resource language as part of my ongoing dissertation work. These range from national documents such as the Saint Lucian national anthem {% cite anthem_2016 %}, speeches from government officials' published press releases bearing Kwéyòl dialogue {% cite louisy_govt_2004 knowledgewalkinstitute_2021 %}, {% cite louisy_govt_2004 knowledgewalkinstitute_2021 %}, Kwéyòl financial document excerpts from the Saint Lucian National Bank's annual reports, poems from national poetry competitions, and local folktales published through collaborative efforts of the local government and SIL International,  {% cite sil_folktale_1985 sil_readingbook_1989 %}. The collection also includes public data on open forum Kwéyòl mentions on social media; particularly the postings by verified fluent Saint Lucian Kwéyòl writers {% cite kweyol_fb_joseph kweyol_works_joseph kweyol_playlists_joseph%}. 

I believe this would be a unique submission as I would compiling all these far-flung works of differing semantic domains and converting them from their various publication formats into analyzable text files. So far, MDPI has been contacted on the matter; other possible publishers are being sought. These include the aforementioned JPCL, and the SCL.
