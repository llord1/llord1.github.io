**The Data Science Biocultural Diversity Action (DSBD) Framework: Reenvisioning Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs for Data Science and Biocultural Diversity Efforts**

*Novel diagnosis and prescriptive frameworks for assessing oneself and surroundings and exploring the prescriptions of various modern data science tools towards amelioration.*


### Questions related to the Framework's Eight Levels: 

- Can Maslow’s "Biological and physiological needs" level be sufficiently explored in data science under a new lens of "Ambience"?

- Can Maslow’s __*"Safety and security needs"*__  level be sufficiently explored in data science under a new lens of __*"Assets"*__?

- Can Maslow’s __*"Love and belonging needs"*__  level be sufficiently explored in data science under a new lens of __*"Affiliation"*__?

- Can Maslow’s __*"Self-esteem needs"*__ level be sufficiently explored in data science under a new lens of __*"Attitudes"*__?

- Can Maslow’s __*"Cognitive needs"*__ level be sufficiently explored in data science under a new lens of __*"Analysis"*__?

- Can Maslow’s __*"Aesthetic needs"*__ level be sufficiently explored in data science under a new lens of __*"Artistry"*__?

- Can Maslow’s __*"Self-actualization needs"*__ level be sufficiently explored in data science under a new lens of __*"Awareness"*__?

- Can Maslow’s __*"Transcendence needs"*__ level be sufficiently explored in data science under a new lens of __*"Altruism"*__?
