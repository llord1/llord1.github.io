### Introduction:

The ease of communication in health care situations is crucial as it is an essential service in society. Recognition of the role of access to adequate language services in the field of health care is increasingly being studied for multilingual settings. However, statistical analysis of the linguistic capacities of medical professions in Saint Lucia has not been extensively pursued. The Saint Lucia Medical and Dental Association encompasses the call practicing doctors and dentists on the island (and excludes other medical workers), yet does not conduct surveys to gauge the role that multilingualism plays in their interactions with patients. This survey seeks to provide a much-needed statistical analysis of key individuals in Saint Lucia's medical field.

### Literature Review (brief):

*The importance of labor demographic and linguistic data monitoring:*

Thoughtful deliberation of linguistics, particularly consideration of language barriers, is increasing in the medical field. As recently as 2019, Sweden conducted a national study on health care professionals' communications through interpreters; this study occurred after noting that many parents utilizing neonatal care were foreign-born and unable to effectively communicate with the healthcare professionals in the local language {% cite patriksson2019health %}. In 2013, an investigation highlighted communications issues between physicians and Spanish-speaking Latin American women with pelvic floor disorders {% cite sevilla2013communication %}. That study highlighted that apart from a patient's lack of disease understanding, there was a lack of Spanish proficiency among the participating physicians. Another 2013 qualitative study (conducted on linguistics) centered around the perceptions of patient-provider communication in breast and cervical cancer-related care when dealing with low-income English and Spanish-speaking women {% cite simon2013perceptions %}. In 2009, there was similar work done on a competent peer support intervention for Spanish-speaking Latinas with breast cancer {% cite napoles2009developing %}. 

Questioning the possible ties of linguistics to various professions is not necessarily new, yet few resources are dedicated to detecting communication issues and improving communication within multilingual countries. One study did investigate Spanish–English bilingual psychotherapists and their personal and professional language development and use {% cite verdinelli2009spanish %}. Another study observed instances where nurses double as interpreters (a study of Spanish-speaking patients in an American primary care setting) {% cite elderkin2001nurses %}. An interesting pivot would be an investigation of multilingual professionals should their primary language not be the dominant language of the country in which they practice, and note if they have sufficient access to language resources. 

Saint Lucia Citizenship by Investment Program (CIP) data {% cite pm_slu_citizenship_2015 imi_team_2021 slu_cip_2020 %} and tourism statistics {% cite gaillard_Finland_2021 cso_2021 %}, can imply that the Saint Lucian public is increasingly being exposed to persons of different nationalities and backgrounds. Notably, the recent establishment of medical schools on the island has also contributed to its increased language diversity. These medical institutions appear to have global appeal and boast of their diverse student body. For example, individuals of Indic backgrounds do appear to be more prominent; the American International Medical University (AIM-U)'s Curriculum "is prepared and monitored by experts including the Medical Council of India and Medical School Accreditation" and the student body observes Deepavali/Diwali celebrations {% cite govt_lc_2015  aimu_2016 aimu_2018 morgan2017location %}. In order to serve the medical demands of the country's inhabitants, both foreign and domestic in origin, medical professionals need to be able to effectively communicate in emergencies. However, information on the medical field's capacity to effectively navigate the multilingual environment is unavailable; data on workers' linguistic capabilities are not readily available. 

It should be noted that  Dr. Didacus Jules and Dame Pearlette Louisy are important linguistic contributors in Saint Lucia, and have made strides in considering the link between linguistics and effective medical care. Over the years they have continuously worked towards improving Kwéyòl literacy and the language's status on the island. During a Kwéyòl language event, Dame Pearlette Louisy acknowledged the efforts of Dr. Edward Cooper, an English pediatrician, that embraced the creole language as part of his medical care on the island  {% cite louisy_2019 %}.  

She also mentioned that a creole discourse and development project was formed to tackle the creation of new Kwéyòl lexical items (in the form of a glossary/vocabulary list), capable of expressing emerging societal concepts {% cite louisy_2019 %}. Medical professionals attempted to collaborate on an understanding of health care vocabulary as it relates to the Kwéyòl language. Jude-Marie Alexis led the effort to create a list of medical words to assist communications among medical professionals. It was said that this project was inspired by their many encounters with elderly persons that needed immediate attention and they were likely to be the highest creole speaking demographic of the population {% cite louisy_2019 %}. Unfortunately, this vocabulary list has been difficult to locate over time; it does not appear that it was able to get to the stage of being widely shared and fully cemented into the teaching materials of local medical professionals.

Ultimately, effective communication would be essential in these situations where crucial care is provided to a vulnerable group. This is key for the wards of the state; mentally ill patients that already have individual struggles with functioning in society at large. We need to ensure that all patients can express their needs and feel reassured that the on-island medical facilities have the resources necessary to interpret them.

### Methodology:

*Participation Consent Agreement Design:*

The details present on the form are as follows:

By clicking the submit button, I agree to the terms & conditions:

Participation Consent Agreement:

This demographic and linguistic research study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Harrisburg University of Science and Technology (HU). This research study is led by Laurel Lord, a Ph. D. candidate in Data Science Department at HU. The faculty advisors for this study are Dr. Kayla Jordan, Assistant Professor of Social Analytics, and Mark Newman, Corporate Faculty of Analytics.

This study is being conducted in compliance with the standards and guidelines given by the HU IRB. The Collaborative Institution Training Initiative (CITI) Programme has certified the researcher, Laurel Lord, for human-subject research.

Purpose of the Study:

The purpose of this research is to gather general demographic data of Saint Lucian medical professionals and identify their patterns of linguistic interactions with the public on the multilingual island of Saint Lucia. There will be a specific focus on the second most prevalent language - Saint Lucian Creole (Kwéyòl, Patois, Patwa). The responses of participants will be run through textual analytical tools to provide insight into the medical environment that Saint Lucians, particularly Kwéyòl speakers, experience.

Participant Tasks:

Each participant is asked to fill out an anonymous online survey to provide their basic demographic details, statements on their multilingual capacities, and statements on the language diversity of patient interactions. The form contains ten (10) questions that each participant should be able to complete in less than twenty minutes.

Participant Risks and Discomforts:

There is no anticipated risk for the participant in this research. All information will be protected, and the confidentiality of the data will be maintained throughout this research.

Survey Benefits:
The collection of profession-specific labour statistical data is uncommon in Saint Lucia. Additionally, there appears to be low societal consideration of the increasing multilingual environment; therefore, data collection and analysis of this specific profession could serve as a template for job-specific data collection and improve the medical care offered to the inhabitants of Saint Lucia.

Participation is Voluntary:

Survey participation is voluntary, and individuals may choose not to participate if uncomfortable with answering any of the questions after signing the consent form; this can be done by withdrawing from the survey at any time without penalty. To withdraw, close the form window without hitting the "Submit" button.

Participant Compensation:

There is no compensation for participation as this research will be distributed internally by the St. Lucia Medical and Dental Association.

Privacy/Confidentiality/Data Security:

Based on the survey's design, there is no overt identifying material being collected; there is no data on one's exact location, email addresses, phone numbers, or government-issued personal identification numbers. All submitted data will be gathered into a password-protected main document. This data will be saved on a standard thumb drive for three years after the publication of the report.

Non-identifiable data, and a report, will be submitted to the St. Lucia Medical and Dental Association. The Central Statistical Office of Saint Lucia, and the Saint Lucia Folk Research Centre (FRC).

Enquires/Questions:

Any questions may be directed to Laurel Lord at lalord@my.harrisburgu.edu. Questions or concerns regarding your rights as a subject in this study may be directed to HU IRB via 717-901-5100 or their website at harrisburgu.edu/irb.


*Question Design:*

Demographic questions included questions on Age, Gender (with the option to self-describe), Ethnicity/Race (with the option to self-describe), and Highest Level of Education as those may add additional context to one's linguistic background; the list of Ethnicity/Race options was inspired by historical settlement data specific to the region, as well as recent immigration data {% cite pm_slu_citizenship_2015 imi_team_2021 slu_cip_2020 %}. An enquiry is also made about one's Citizenship, as this may give additional details as to whether locals or foreign nationals are more likely to be exposed to diverse linguistic backgrounds that benefit the medical field. 

Questions into the number of years one has been a practicing professional, areas of practice, and current working environment may reflect one's experiences and one's likelihood of exposure to multilingual situations; annual income questions may speak to possible future incentives for utilising or acquiring additional language skills. Inquiring into the locations of one's operations may not be suitable here as persons of this profession may operate island-wide.

Linguistic questions enquired into participant awareness of non-English language assistance programmes in their work environment, if multilinguals' skills were ever a useful asset, and if they perceived language barriers while executing their required tasks; it is hoped that such data could lead to improved training on currently available resources, or inspire improved resource allocation towards language needs.

Like the list of Ethnicity/Race options, language list options were inspired by historical settlement data specific to the region, and recent immigration and tourism data {% cite pm_slu_citizenship_2015 imi_team_2021 slu_cip_2020 %}. Options were included for survey participants that may have encountered various forms of sign language, languages that were not represented within the scope of the survey, and languages that they could not readily identify ('unrecognised languages').

Additionally, linguistic questions focused on gathering details on one's first language, and if they spoke additional languages. There was also a focus on the frequency with which one encountered various languages; this was an attempt to see if the current language environment truly reflected historical settlement, immigration, and tourism data. It is hoped that the information gathered from these questions may better enable the resource allocation to the language needs of works and the people they serve.

#### Future Works:

Ultimately, the survey may not be perfect and may have room for improvement in the future. It is hoped that these works will serve as a template for annual assessments moving forward. With the current iteration, the window for describing linguistic experiences was deliberately not rigid; it allowed participants to consider and comment on relevant linguistic experiences encountered throughout the entirety of their professional life. To avoid overlapping data points in the future, the next survey interval will need to be about a year from the last launch; this would allow better annual trend tracking of these professionals' experiences. Future studies may include the study of other medical workers such as the employees of the OKEU Hospital and mental health workers.
