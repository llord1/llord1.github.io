<h3 id="safety-and-security-needs-can-be-explored-as-topics-related-to-assets"><strong><em>Safety and security needs</em></strong> can be explored as topics related to <strong><em>Assets</em></strong>.</h3>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction:</h3>

<p>The American Bar Association does gather Legal Profession Statistics; their current statistical data is used to assist with research on lawyers and the legal profession. Their website notes data on the topics of Lawyer Demographics (including matters of Disability, Women, and Minority/People of Color). It also encompasses Justice System Statistics (including topics on Public Perception of Justice System/Lawyers and the Justice System), Court Statistics (including Cases Filed, and Criminal Justice Statistics). This association also notes the topics of Law Students and Education and Legal Salaries (and related Attrition/Retention data).</p>

<p>Lawyer demographics in Saint Lucia do not appear to be gathered. A representative of The Central Statistical Office of Saint Lucia stated that the data in the country’s “Labourforce survey is not disaggregated in such a way to get a count of all lawyers”. It was also stated that since the Labourforce survey “utilizes a sample if it were to give a figure it would not be representative”.</p>

<h3 id="questions">Questions:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Assessing the link between crime and language. Could miscommunication between prestige and heritage language speakers hinder legal defenses? Are there any metrics on lawyers’ multilingual lawyers on the island? Are there any laws related to representation requirements (do lawyers assess the language needs of clients to decide how best to assist them)? What are the rates of incarceration of predominantly Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language speakers? What are the inmate metrics per district of origin (there is a popular belief that most Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language speakers are located in the Southern part of the country)?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="methodology">Methodology:</h3>

<p>Chi-square test of independence</p>

<p><em>Survey design (questions)</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Which category below includes your age?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>19 or younger</p>

<p>20-24</p>

<p>25-29</p>

<p>30-34</p>

<p>35-39</p>

<p>40-44</p>

<p>45-49</p>

<p>50-54</p>

<p>55-59</p>

<p>60-64</p>

<p>65-69</p>

<p>70 or older</p>

<p>Choose not to respond</p>

<p>This question is posed as a standard demographic question, yet it is also important as speaks to the current and future state of the legal linguistic environment. Noting age may highlight multilingualism trends among age groups. For example, if multilingualism is more prominent in the younger lawyers, then the projection of multilingual representation would be positive. However, if multilingual tendencies are clustered among older lawyers, then this study may serve to highlight needed points of improvement in the legal system in an increasingly multilingual society. Additionally, the age range chosen was based on the fact that lawyers typically obtain higher education levels beyond high-school, and remain in practice past the age of 65 [source].</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>What is your gender?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Woman</p>

<p>Man</p>

<p>My gender identity is not listed above</p>

<hr />

<p>Choose not to respond</p>

<p>Gender identification is another standard demographic question, however, it is needed here to highlight if there are any differences in linguistics interests among the lawyers. Females are often believed to be more capable of and interested in linguistic acquisition and practice. Data gathered could confirm or dispute this assumption.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>How would you describe your ethnicity/race? (Tick one box only)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>White/North European</p>

<p>Mediterranean (eg Greek, Italian, Turkish)</p>

<p>Black Afro-Caribbean</p>

<p>Indian subcontinent</p>

<p>SE Asian/Chinese</p>

<p>Mixed parentage</p>

<p>Other (please specify)</p>

<hr />

<p>Not known</p>

<p>Choose not to respond</p>

<p>Identifying participant ethnicity/race is another standard demographic inquiry, nevertheless, it is needed here to highlight if there are any differences in linguistics interests among the lawyers based on their backgrounds. One’s household and upbringing may shape or influence one’s interests. Multiculturalism is quite prevalent in the Caribbean, however, one’s multilingualism might be impacted by one’s upbringing. While formal education may be a primary factor in one’s language acquisition, various states of immigration over generations, or other forms of diversity in one’s household, might influence their linguistic capacities.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>In what law-related environment are you currently working?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>In private practice, in a firm with less than 5 lawyers</p>

<p>In private practice, in a firm with 5-15 lawyers</p>

<p>In private practice, in a firm with 16-25 lawyers</p>

<p>In private practice, in a firm with 26-50 lawyers</p>

<p>In private practice, in a firm with 51 or more lawyers</p>

<p>In government</p>

<p>In a not for profit organization</p>

<p>In an academic institution</p>

<p>Other (please specify)</p>

<p>Lawyers may choose to focus on different areas of the law. The cliental they encounter may be influenced by this specialization. Inquiring into one’s area of specialization will highlight which areas of the law may be associated with a need to speak multiple languages; more specifically, which areas of the law in Saint Lucia, are more likely to require an understanding of  Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Which languages do you speak? Please select all that apply?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>English</p>

<p>Latin</p>

<p>Saint Lucian Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/Patios)</p>

<p>French</p>

<p>Spanish</p>

<p>Dutch</p>

<p>Portuguese</p>

<p>Hindi</p>

<p>Mandarin</p>

<p>Other (please specify)</p>

<p>This question is one of the most crucial to this study. English is listed as it is indeed the main language spoken. Apart from modern English, lawyers, and doctors, can claim to be multilingual based on their foundational studies of Latin; placing this detail acknowledges this field facet.  Indeed, Saint Lucian Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/Patios) is inquired about, as it is the heritage language of the island. French and Spanish are inquired about as they are common language offerings at all high schools on the island. Dutch, and Portuguese, and to a lesser extent Hindi, are other common languages to the rest of the Caribbean due to colonialization. Due to an increased presence of Chinese investors and tourists in the Caribbean, and general funding of local projects by China, one’s ability to understand Mandarin is becoming increasingly valuable.</p>

<ul>
  <li>*If you do speak more than one language, how did you come to learn each?</li>
</ul>

<p>As part of my school education (required)</p>

<p>As part of my school education (elective)</p>

<p>As a personal interest (for career, personal enrichment, etc.)</p>

<p>As part of communicating with my family and friends</p>

<p>Understanding where and how one engages in language learning might highlight environments that foster multilingualism in lawyers. The learning of certain languages may lend itself to formal and informal settings. In Saint Lucia, it is highly likely that most language education would be done in a formal school setting. Overall, the national heritage language of this island would typically be learned informally. Saint Lucian Kwéyòl only recently began being formally taught to young children (between the ages of 6-12) in less than a handful of schools, and adult learners; however, since the major fire at the National Folk Resource Center, most classes have reverted to more private sessions.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Overall, how many languages do you speak/understand?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>1</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>3</p>

<p>4</p>

<p>5+</p>

<p>Choose not to respond</p>

<p>Once again, apart from modern English, lawyers can claim to be multilingual based on their foundational studies of Latin. Specifically requesting quantification the number of languages spoken improves question clarity. Since English and Latin are most likely part of a lawyer’s education, and French and Spanish are commonly taught in schools, a Saint Lucian Lawyer may have a base of four languages. Therefore a lawyer speaking more than four languages may demonstrate high levels of multilingualism, and perhaps creole may be one of the additional languages being acknowledged.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>If you do speak more than one language, has this skill been crucial to representing/communicating with a client?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Yes</p>

<p>No</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Have you ever declined to represent a client due to perceived language barriers?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Yes</p>

<p>No</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Have you ever encountered language barriers with Saint Lucian Kwéyòl speakers?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Yes</p>

<p>No</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Rate how strongly you agree or disagree with the following statement:</em></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Saint Lucian Lawyers should know more than one language</em></p>

<p>1= “Strongly Agree” to	5= “Strongly Disagree”</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Rate how strongly you agree or disagree with the following statement:</em></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Saint Lucian Lawyers should know Saint Lucian Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/Patios)</em></p>

<p>1= “Strongly Agree” to	5= “Strongly Disagree”</p>
