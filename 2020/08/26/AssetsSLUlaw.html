<h3 id="safety-and-security-needs-can-be-explored-as-topics-related-to-assets"><strong><em>Safety and security needs</em></strong> can be explored as topics related to <strong><em>Assets</em></strong>.</h3>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction:</h3>

<p>Several careers in society can contribute to providing the general sense of safety and security that Maslow has referred to in his famous hierarchy of needs. However, obvious, yet often overlooked issues in communication can mean the difference between life and death in fields of practice such as medicine and law enforcement. Therefore, thoughtful data collection and monitoring of these crucial services can enhance and optimize their performance.</p>

<p>Thoughtful deliberation of linguistics, particularly consideration of language barriers, is increasing in the medical field. As recently as 2019, Sweden conducted a national study on health care professionals’ communications through interpreters; this study was conducted after noting that many parents utilizing neonatal care were foreign-born and unable to effectively communicate with the healthcare professionals in the local language <a class="citation" href="#patriksson2019health">(Patriksson et al., 2019)</a>. In 2013, linguistic work had been done to highlight communications issues between physicians and Spanish-speaking Latin American women with pelvic floor disorders <a class="citation" href="#sevilla2013communication">(Sevilla et al., 2013)</a>; this study highlighted that apart from patients’ lack of disease understanding, there was a lack of Spanish proficiency among the participating physicians. Another 2013 qualitative study conducted on linguistics, centered around the perceptions of patient-provider communication in breast and cervical cancer-related care when dealing with low-income English and Spanish-speaking women <a class="citation" href="#simon2013perceptions">(Simon et al., 2013)</a>. In 2009, efforts were made in a similar work that was conducted on competent peer support intervention for Spanish-speaking Latinas with breast cancer <a class="citation" href="#napoles2009developing">(Nápoles-Springer et al., 2009)</a>.</p>

<p>Need to fix this section:</p>

<p><em>Questioning the possible ties of linguistics to various professions is not necessarily new, yet few resources are being dedicated to detecting communication issues and improving communication within multilingual countries.</em></p>

<p><em>More interesting in the pivot of looking at persons who are already multilingual in a field, and noting if they have sufficient training and resources when their primary language is not the dominant language of the country in which they practice. One study did investigate Spanish–English bilingual psychotherapists and their Personal and professional language development and use <a class="citation" href="#verdinelli2009spanish">(Verdinelli &amp; Biever, 2009)</a>. Another study was conducted on instances where nurses double as interpreters (a study of Spanish-speaking patients in a US primary care setting) <a class="citation" href="#elderkin2001nurses">(Elderkin-Thompson et al., 2001)</a>.</em></p>

<p><em>The consideration for a legal system’s ties to linguistics is not new, however, the topic has not been thoroughly explored (particularly in extensively multilingual and multicultural settings such as the Caribbean).</em></p>

<p><em>There are indeed benefits to being a multilingual lawyer. As of 2015,  Brian Porro, the principal translator at the Directorate-General for Translation at the European Commission, eagerly sought to hire lawyer-linguists at the European Court of Justice; instead, he noted that there was “a dearth of suitably qualified prospective English candidates in law with an additional language” [theguardian.com/law/2015/jul/07/all]. Therefore, this scarcity of capable multilingual lawyers may allow for international law firms to extend higher salaries to bilingual employees. Moreover, Porro suggested that speaking additional languages facilitated better communication. He added that the very presence of a sub-discipline could highlight one’s ability to concentrate and deploy your language skills in legal practice. He also notes that one’s language skills could also provide opportunities to work abroad.</em></p>

<p>While data collection on the various professions can be conducted by private companies, it is typically undertaken by government-backed labor agencies, to ensure that the data is freely available to the public. In America, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics collects such data and hosts it on a public website [bls.gov]. While not all developing nations have been able to dedicate resources to the close monitoring of this data, its value is increasingly recognized.</p>

<p>While the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics provides general information on the demographics of the lawyers in the country, the American Bar Association (ABA) gathers more detailed information on Legal Profession Statistics [americanbar.org] <a class="citation" href="#BLS2020">(BLS, 2020)</a>. Their current statistical data is used to assist with research on lawyers and the legal profession. Their website notes data on the topics of lawyer demographics (including matters of disability, women, and minority/people of color). It also encompasses justice system statistics (including topics on public perception of justice system/lawyers and the justice system), court statistics (including cases filed, and criminal justice statistics). this association also notes the topics of law students and education and legal salaries (and related attrition/retention data).</p>

<p><em>Currently, lawyer demographics in Saint Lucia (SLU) do not appear to be centrally gathered. The 2016 Labour Force Survey, made publicly available by The Central Statistical Office of SLU, did inquire into participants’ industry - “What is the name of the business where you/……. work? What type of activity is carried on there?” <a class="citation" href="#govtSLU_Labour_2019">(govt.lc, 2019)</a>.</em></p>

<p>However, the dataset ultimately appears to have been simplified to the point where details on individual professions were rendered indiscernible. The closest response, related to lawyers, would be one that highlighted “professional, scientific and technical activities”; this made up 1.0%  (51 participants) of the survey. A representative of The Central Statistical Office of SLU stated that the data in the country’s 2016 Labour Force Survey was “not disaggregated in such a way to get a count of all lawyers” <a class="citation" href="#govtSLU_Labour_2019">(govt.lc, 2019)</a>. It was also stated that since the 2016 Labour Force Survey “utilizes a sample if it were to give a figure it would not be representative” <a class="citation" href="#govtSLU_Labour_2019">(govt.lc, 2019)</a>. Ultimately, even the president of the Bar Association of SLU, also confirmed that she was unaware of the departments of government bearing statistical data specific to lawyers.</p>

<p>Saint Lucia’s National Environmental Information System (NEIS)  has been one of the latest governmental attempts at collecting and organizing national data <a class="citation" href="#govtSLU_NEIS_2019">(govt.lc, 2019)</a>, <a class="citation" href="#govtSLU_NEIS">(govt.lc, 2020)</a>, <a class="citation" href="#govtSLUdata">(govt.lc, 2020)</a>. This “Project Reporting System for Multilateral Environmental Agreement (MEA) Implementation and Environmental Information Management” is regarded as a “legal instrument with binding effects on countries that have agreed to become parties” <a class="citation" href="#govtSLU_NEIS">(govt.lc, 2020)</a>. Saint Lucia’s participation in this international agreement, enhances global agreements and sustainable development projects moving forward. However, one current category that highlights the “employed labor force by industry”, is classified as having a low priority level.</p>

<p>A need for additional data regarding lawyer demographics in Saint Lucia has been identified. To address this need, while following social distancing protocols, an online survey has been selected as the tool of data collection. Ultimately, such a survey can be applied to lawyers, nurses, or police officers - any profession that requires direct extended interaction with a citizen to provide a sense of safety and security.</p>

<p>St. Lucia is a sovereign island nation in the Commonwealth of Nations, but because Saint Lucia was both a French and English colony before it gained independence on February 22nd, 1979, the legal system has been a mix of civil and English common law. There is an appointed Governor-General (representing the Queen), and the Prime Minister and cabinet (bearing executive power). The legislative branch is operated by a 17-member two-chambered House of Assembly; the judiciary is part of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court system (headquartered in Castries, St. Lucia’s capital) (missing reference).</p>

<h3 id="questions">Questions:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>Assessing the link between crime and language.</em>
With so many languages being spoken in Saint Lucia, it begs the question could miscommunication between prestige and heritage language speakers hinder legal defenses? In order to truly investigate whether locals have sufficient legal representation, one could also investigate if there are any metrics on multilingual lawyers on the island? As part of investigating the systems that help or hinder communication in this field, there many need to be an investigation into whether there are any laws related to legal linguistic representation requirements (do lawyers assess the language needs of clients to decide how best to assist them)?</li>
</ul>

<p>Additional (possibly future) studies may collect data linguistic data on the current prison populations concerning the rates of incarceration of predominantly Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language speakers. This questions the existence of inmate metrics; particularly linguistic data. It would be helpful if location data could also be collected; forming information from the resulting analysis, per district, could dispel or reinforce one popular belief that most Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language speakers are located in the Southern part of the country.</p>

<p><a href="https://forms.gle/8yUuGYaCidMgbN5E8">See draft survey with consent form here</a></p>

<h3 id="methodology">Methodology:</h3>

<p>Chi-square test of independence</p>

<p><em>Survey design (questions)</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>1. Please indicate your age from the following ranges.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Less than 18, 18-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, 70 or older, Choose not to respond.</p>

<p>The age range (multiple choice) was based on the ABA data that indicates lawyers typically obtain higher education levels beyond high-school and remain in practice past the age of 65 [source]; the median age of all U.S. workers was 42.3 years old, yet very few lawyers are younger than 25 and the median age for U.S. lawyers in 2019 was 47.5 years old. This question is posed as a standard demographic question, yet it is also important as speaks to the current and future state of the legal linguistic environment. Noting age may highlight multilingualism trends among age groups. For example, if multilingualism is more prominent in the younger lawyers, then the projection of multilingual representation would be positive. However, if multilingual tendencies are clustered among older lawyers, then this study may serve to highlight needed points of improvement in the legal system in an increasingly multilingual society.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>2. Please indicate which of the following classifications best describe (s) you.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Man</p>

<p>Woman</p>

<p>Choose not to respond</p>

<p>Other (please specify)</p>

<hr />

<p>Gender identification is another standard (multiple choice) demographic question, however, it is useful to gather this data check whether the August 2020 American trend of men outnumbering women (especially in leadership), is replicated in and persistent in the Caribbean country of Saint Lucia <a class="citation" href="#ABA2020Profile">(Association, 2020; Clio, 2020; Ernde, 2019)</a>. There may also be a need to highlight if there are any differences in linguistics interests among the lawyers. Females are often believed to be more capable of and interested in linguistic acquisition and practice. Data gathered could confirm or dispute this assumption.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>3. Please indicate which of the following best describe (s) your ethnicity/race.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Amerindian (Native Caribbean People)/American Indian/Alaska Native</p>

<p>Black/African/Afro-Caribbean</p>

<p>White/North European</p>

<p>Mediterranean (Greek, Italian, Turkish, Syrian, etc.)</p>

<p>Hispanic/ Latino (Mexican, Central or South American, or other Spanish or Portuguese, etc.)</p>

<p>While the ABA noted that “most state bars and state licensing agencies do not track race and ethnicity in the profession”, in 2020 there was an increase in this type of data collection <a class="citation" href="#ABA2020Profile">(Association, 2020)</a>, <a class="citation" href="#clio_2020">(Clio, 2020)</a>, <a class="citation" href="#AttorneyAtWork_2019">(Ernde, 2019)</a>. As of 2010, only 11.4% of all American lawyers were men and women of color, and this only rose to 14.1% in 2020 <a class="citation" href="#ABA2020Profile">(Association, 2020)</a>, <a class="citation" href="#clio_2020">(Clio, 2020)</a>, <a class="citation" href="#AttorneyAtWork_2019">(Ernde, 2019)</a>. In developed countries, like America, it is said that minorities remain underrepresented in the legal profession; however, there is limited information on the legal environment of the Caribbean-an environment where the majority of the population would historically be non-white. As of the 2010 Saint Lucian census, the “ethnic group” of 
“African Descents” represented about 85.28 percent of the population (the highest); this was distantly followed by the “Mixed” category with 10.85 percent, and the “East Indian” at 2.16 percent <a class="citation" href="#CSO_SLU2010">(CSO, 2020)</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, one’s household and upbringing may shape or influence one’s interests. Multiculturalism is quite prevalent in the Caribbean, however, one’s multilingualism might be impacted by one’s upbringing. While formal education may be a primary factor in one’s language acquisition, various states of immigration over generations, or other forms of diversity in one’s household, might influence their linguistic capacities.
Identifying participant ethnicity/race is another standard demographic inquiry, nevertheless, it is needed here to highlight if there are any differences in linguistics interests among the lawyers based on their backgrounds.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>4. Please indicate the number of years you have been in practice (number of years since your first call to the bar in the Common-Wealth).</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Less than 1, 1-5, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20, 21-25, 26-30, 31 or more, Choose not to respond.</p>

<p>This is not a typical demographic question, however, it is one that can reveal data on the vibrancy or stagnancy of the field in terms of linguistics. This is an attempt to pinpoint how long one can thrive in an industry without the need for multilingual skills. It will be interesting to explore if career longevity is strongly or weakly associated with one’s linguistic acquisitions.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>5. Please indicate your current law-related working environment.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>In private practice, in a firm with less than 5 lawyers</p>

<p>In private practice, in a firm with 5-15 lawyers</p>

<p>In private practice, in a firm with 16-25 lawyers</p>

<p>In private practice, in a firm with 26-50 lawyers</p>

<p>In private practice, in a firm with 51 or more lawyers</p>

<p>Lawyers may choose to focus on different areas of the law. The cliental they encounter may be influenced by this specialization. Inquiring into one’s area of specialization will highlight which areas of the law may be associated with a need to speak multiple languages; more specifically, which areas of the law in Saint Lucia, are more likely to require an understanding of  Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>6. Please indicate your areas of practice; please check all that apply.</em>

</ul>

<p>An additional means of narrowing down underlying multilinguistic tendencies in this field is to inquire into one’s areas of practice. St. Lucia is a sovereign island nation in the Commonwealth of Nations, but because Saint Lucia was both a French and English colony before it gained independence on February 22nd, 1979, the legal system has been a mix of civil and English common law (missing reference).</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>7. Please indicate your average annual income.</em></li>

<p>Based on one’s average salary per case, there could be an argument for the economic reinforcement of certain linguistic standards. It may be interesting to note if multilingual able to request and acquire more money due to their linguistic abilities. The Average Attorney Salary of a lawyer located in the sister island country of Dominica is around 2,950 XCD per month <a class="citation" href="#DOMsalary">(salaryexplorer.com, 2020)</a>. It is said that salaries range from 1,360 XCD (lowest) to 4,680 XCD (highest). Yet, according to salaryexplorer.com, a Saint Lucian  Attorney typically earns around 5,500 XCD per month;  this is with salaries ranging from 2,530 XCD (lowest) to 8,750 XCD (highest). It should be noted that Saint Lucia’s minimum wage rate was last changed at the beginning of 2013, yet it stands at XCD 300 a month for office clerks, XCD 200 for shop assistants, and XCD 160 for messengers according to minimum-wage.org <a class="citation" href="#SLU2020wages">(minimum-wage.org, 2020)</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>8. Please indicate your proficiency in speaking, reading, writing, and or understanding the languages listed below.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Column Titles: Speak, Write, Read, Understand</p>

<p>Row Titles: English, Saint Lucian Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/Patios), Haitian Creole, French, Spanish, Papiamento, Portuguese, Dutch, Hindi (or any Indian subcontinental language not listed), Arabic (or any Mediterranean language not listed), Russian (or any Eurasian language not listed), Japanese, Mandarin, Any form of sign language.</p>

<p>This question is one of the most crucial to this study. English is listed as it is indeed the main language spoken (a prestige language) in Saint Lucia. However, Saint Lucia is indeed a multilingual country, and therefore assumptions cannot be made as to one’s full competencies of English; indeed one may have been hired based on being a native speaker of another language, or a variety of other scenarios. Yet, the form will only be presented in English, as a certain degree of English competency is required of professionals that practice in Saint Lucia (most legal documents are indeed written in English).</p>

<p>Notably, apart from modern English, legal (and medical) professionals can claim to be multilingual, based on their foundational studies of Latin. Latin has been declared a dead language, and its inclusion would indeed seem redundant, as the field already recognizes this knowledge. Questioning one’s fluency in Latin may also spark negative feelings from participants, as the language is intrinsically linked to the mastery of their profession.</p>

<p>Saint Lucian Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/Patios) is inquired about, as it is the heritage language of the island. While a language vitality survey has not been conducted in more than twenty years, the last records indicate that above ninety percent of the Saint Lucian population converses Saint Lucian Kwéyòl. It stands to reason that law practitioners on the island may have encountered or have had to represent speakers of this language.</p>

<p>Haitian Creole is another heritage language of the Caribbean, however, it is fully recognized, regulated, and formally taught in schools; especially on the island of Haiti. There is evidence to support the fact that several legal professionals, from the Caribbean and abroad, have interacted with Haitian Creole speakers, particularly to assist with disaster relief services. Haitian Creole was therefore added to reduce any possible confusion with the classification of Haitian Creole as Saint Lucian Kwéyòl. To further reduce confusion surrounding the creole languages of the Caribbean, Papiamento was acknowledged with its own option.</p>

<p>French and Spanish are included as these are common language offerings at all high schools on the island of Saint Lucia. These languages reflect the greater Caribbean environment, as several countries recognize and teach French and Spanish as their prestige languages; this includes countries such as Martinique and Guadeloupe, and Cuba, respectively. Dutch,  Portuguese, and to a lesser extent Hindi (or any other Indian subcontinental language), are other common languages to the rest of the Caribbean due to colonialization and indentured labor.</p>

<p>Arabic immigrants (and others from the Mediterranean region) do have a strong presence in the Saint Lucian business environment, and therefore, may have had a need for legal representation on the island. Japanese is taught in Saint Lucia by humanitarian volunteers as part of their Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) work <a class="citation" href="#kobayashi_2020">(Kobayashi, 2020)</a>. Due to an increased presence of Chinese investors and tourists in the Caribbean, and general funding of local projects by China, one’s ability to understand Mandarin is becoming increasingly valuable. Once again these immigrants may have had a need for legal representation on the island.</p>

<p>It should be noted that Saint Lucia has established a system for Citizenship by Investment (CIP) (missing reference). Local lawyers that practice in this area have a greater probability of interacting with persons from various parts of the world; particularly interacting with persons from areas that had no prior historic (colonial) immigration or language ties to the country. Persons from Russia, Asia, and the Middle East have been noted as having increasingly high rates of interest in the CIP programs of the Caribbean <a class="citation" href="#nesheim_CIP_2020">(Nesheim, 2020; CBF, 2020)</a>. The creation of the categories was developed to best encapsulate as many interaction scenarios as possible.</p>

<p>The column category “understand” was added to account for the possible occurrence of receptive bilingualism among lawyers in the Caribbean. This consideration is valid as multilingualism is prevalent in this region; persons here may encounter various languages, yet have been unable to effectively respond. The presence of a prestige language, such as English, may draw speakers away from heritage languages;  these heritage languages can suffer from dropping numbers of speakers when receptive bilingualism is not followed up with focused efforts.</p>

<p>Understanding where and how one engages in language learning might highlight environments that foster multilingualism in lawyers. The learning of certain languages may take place in formal and informal settings. In Saint Lucia, it is highly likely that most language education would be done in a formal school setting. Overall, the national heritage language of this island would typically be learned informally. Saint Lucian Kwéyòl only recently began being formally taught to young children (between the ages of 6-12) in less than a handful of schools, and adult learners; however, since the major fire at the National Folk Resource Center, most classes have reverted to more private sessions.</p>

<p>Since this survey is unable to acquire data from past clients, this question serves to address the languages that lawyers commonly encounter. The language one speaks is not guaranteed to be what is encountered. It will be interesting to note where the client and lawyer languages overlap and where they do not.</p>

<p>This question seeks to explore the personal linguistic limitations of lawyers in a multilingual environment. This may reinforce the perceived need for lawyers to acquire additional languages.</p>

<p>This question seeks to explore the boundaries of fluency that a lawyer may encounter when attempting to represent local Saint Lucian Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/Patios) speaking clientele. This heritage language is the second most spoken language on the island. Reduced language barriers would allow lawyers to better relay facts, arguments, and sentiments of clients with the distinct Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/Patios) speaking background. This may establish if there is or is not a need for lawyers to acquire the language.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>14. If you do speak more than one language, please indicate if your multilingual skill was ever crucial to representing a client.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Yes</p>

<p>No</p>

<p>Prefer not to respond</p>

<p>This question seeks to understand the current and demand for multilingualism in lawyering, based on past demand. These details may reveal sufficiencies as well as insufficiencies concerning the adequate legal representation of  Saint Lucian clients. Saint Lucia is a multilingual country, and a lawyer with multiple languages may stand a better chance of not only attracting a diverse and numerous clientele base; reduced language barriers would allow lawyers to better relay facts, arguments, and sentiments of clients with diverse backgrounds.</p>

  <li><em>15. Please indicate if your workplace offers any formal support to handle linguistic diversity in clients.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Yes</p>

<p>No</p>

<p>Prefer not to respond</p>

<p>This question is simply to assess the resources available within this multilingual environment. If there is a substantial support system already in existence, this could also suggest that the industry has considered the connection of linguistics to the legal field. This question may be flawed since it could be one large firm, but not the entire industry, that has such an interest in linguistics. However, it could be argued that based on a favorable overall total percentage of participation, could still have a positive reflection on the industry.</p>
