### Introduction to Surveys:

While employing various data science techniques to analyze the current vitality of a low-resource language may provide useful information, on its own, this application of data science would provide an incomplete perspective of a language that arose from purely oral communication. Linguistic surveys may be the best way to assess the vitality of a low-resource language.  I have attempted to utilize surveys to establish foundational truths about the current vitality status of the Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language.  

In an attempt to bolster the execution of the current Saint Lucian national language policy, I hope to conduct a series of language surveys, with particular attention to the vitality of the Kwéyòl language. This undertaking seeks to create quantifiable data on the current status of the language highlighting the details of crucial Saint Lucian labor force members. Due to the increasingly multilingual landscape, effective communication on the island increasingly may involve applying various language skills to meet each situation. The work of teachers, medical workers (in the realms of both physical and mental health), lawyers, and law enforcement, are valuable to this study as their work typically encompasses frequent human interaction.

These surveys are essential to supporting the updated Saint Lucian National Language Policy. Without quantifiable base metrics, it may be challenging to monitor and gauge the amelioration of the current language conditions. For example, it would be problematic to establish facts about the improvement of nationwide Kwéyòl literacy without ever exploring the existing capabilities of the public. Moreover, without the data collected from these surveys, it would be difficult to efficiently allocate the necesary resources towards national language services. For example, one would be unable to definitively confirm if and which communities are more Kwéyòl literate than others, and how the skills of those communities can be effectively leveraged to aid the weaker ones.

Additionally, these language surveys seek to provide information not available in previous language surveys. Most of the past ones appear to request information on how the community 'feels' about the current situation and also inquired into the public's opinions and suggestions for improvement and resource allocation strategies. However, these surveys will attempt to focus on the actual experiences based on their exposure to various languages and to quantify the linguistic capabilities of the public. Moreover, one survey will specifically focus on quantifying the vitality of the Kwéyòl language. 

The distribution of surveys has begun. The Bar Association of Saint Lucia assisted in the distribution of one language survey to its lawyers; it aimed to explore lawyers' multilingual capabilities and the language resources available to their clients. Another survey is underway with the Saint Lucian Ministry of Education. This survey aimed at conducting a teacher survey to gauge the role that multilingualism plays in their interactions with students. A few more surveys may be attempted before the end of my dissertation period, particularly an island-wide survey into the vitality of the Kwéyòl language. Most of the remaining surveys are already in their draft stage; distribution of which may be ideal for the upcoming Kwéyòl festivities in October (Jounen Kwéyòl).
