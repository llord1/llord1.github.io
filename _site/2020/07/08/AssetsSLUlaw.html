<h3 id="introduction">Introduction:</h3>

<p>Several careers in society, aid providing a sense of safety and security to the public; these crucial services should therefore be carefully monitored to aid in their optimum performance. As recently as 2019, Sweden conducted a national study on health care professional’s communication through an interpreter; this was done after noting that many parents in neonatal care are foreign-born and unable to effectively communicate with healthcare professionals (as they do not speak the local language) [pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31426785/]. The results indicated insufficient awareness of guidelines in all neonatal units and that additional training was required, particularly of nurse assistants. Indeed, careful consideration of language barriers can mean the difference between life and death in medicine as well as in law enforcement. Careful consideration of linguistics is increasing in the medical field. For example, a qualitative study was conducted on the perceptions of patient-provider communication in breast and cervical cancer-related care, when dealing with low-income English-and Spanish-speaking women; additionally, efforts made in another work to develop a culturally competent peer support intervention for Spanish-speaking Latinas with breast cancer.</p>

<p>There are additional benefits to being a multilingual lawyer. As of 2015,  Brian Porro, the principal translator at the Directorate-General for Translation at the European Commission, eagerly sought to hire lawyer-linguists at the European Court of Justice; instead, he noted that there was “a dearth of suitably qualified prospective English candidates in law with an additional language” [theguardian.com/law/2015/jul/07/all]. Therefore, this scarcity of capable multilingual lawyers may allow for international law firms to extend higher salaries to bilingual employees. Moreover, Porro suggested that speaking additional languages facilitated better communication. He added that the very presence of a sub-discipline could highlight one’s ability to concentrate and deploy your language skills in legal practice. He also notes that one’s language skills could also provide opportunities to work abroad.</p>

Latin América: A Challenge to the Common Lawyer</p>

<p>While data collection on the various professions can be conducted by private companies, it is typically undertaken by government-backed labor agencies, to ensure that the data is freely available to the public. In America, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics collects such data and hosts it on a public website [bls.gov]. While not all developing nations have been able to dedicate resources to the close monitoring of this data, its value is increasingly recognized.</p>

<p>While the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics provides general information on the demographics of the lawyers in the country, the American Bar Association (ABA) gathers more detailed information on Legal Profession Statistics [americanbar.org] [bls.gov]. Their current statistical data is used to assist with research on lawyers and the legal profession. Their website notes data on the topics of lawyer demographics (including matters of disability, women, and minority/people of color). It also encompasses justice system statistics (including topics on public perception of justice system/lawyers and the justice system), court statistics (including cases filed, and criminal justice statistics). this association also notes the topics of law students and education and legal salaries (and related attrition/retention data).</p>

<p>Currently, lawyer demographics in Saint Lucia (SLU) do not appear to be centrally gathered. The 2016 Labour Force Survey, made publicly available by The Central Statistical Office of SLU, did inquire into participants’ industry - “What is the name of the business where you/……. work? What type of activity is carried on there?” [data.govt.lc/dataset/]. However, the dataset ultimately appears to have been simplified to the point where details on individual professions were rendered indiscernible. The closest response, related to lawyers, would be one that highlighted “professional, scientific and technical activities”; this made up 1.0%  (51 participants) of the survey. A representative of The Central Statistical Office of SLU stated that the data in the country’s 2016 Labour Force Survey was “not disaggregated in such a way to get a count of all lawyers”. It was also stated that since the 2016 Labour Force Survey “utilizes a sample if it were to give a figure it would not be representative”. Ultimately, even the president of the Bar Association of SLU, also confirmed that she was unaware of the departments of government bearing statistical data specific to lawyers</p>

<p>Saint Lucia’s National Environmental Information System (NEIS)  has been one of the latest governmental attempts at collecting and organizing national data [data.govt.lc/dataset]. This “Project Reporting System for Multilateral Environmental Agreement (MEA) Implementation and Environmental Information Management” is regarded as a “legal instrument with binding effects on countries that have agreed to become parties”.  Saint Lucia’s participation in this international agreement, enhances global agreements and sustainable development projects moving forward. However, one current category that highlights the “employed labor force by industry”, is classified as having a low priority level.</p>

<p>A need for additional data regarding lawyer demographics in Saint Lucia has been identified. To address this need, while following social distancing protocols, an online survey has been selected as the tool of data collection. Ultimately, such a survey can be applied to lawyers, nurses, or police officers - any profession that requires direct extended interaction with a citizen to provide a sense of safety and security.</p>

<h3 id="questions">Questions:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Assessing the link between crime and language. Could miscommunication between prestige and heritage language speakers hinder legal defenses? Are there any metrics on lawyers’ multilingual lawyers on the island? Are there any laws related to representation requirements (do lawyers assess the language needs of clients to decide how best to assist them)? What are the rates of incarceration of predominantly Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language speakers? What are the inmate metrics per district of origin (there is a popular belief that most Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language speakers are located in the Southern part of the country)?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="methodology">Methodology:</h3>

<p>Chi-square test of independence</p>

<p><em>Survey design (questions)</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Please select your age:</em></li>

<p>Less than 18</p>

<p>18-24</p>

<p>25-29</p>

<p>60-64</p>

<p>65-69</p>

<p>70 or older</p>

<p>Choose not to respond</p>

<p>The age range (multiple choice) was based on the ABA data that indicates lawyers typically obtain higher education levels beyond high-school and remain in practice past the age of 65 [source]; the median age of all U.S. workers was 42.3 years old, yet very few lawyers are younger than 25 and the median age for U.S. lawyers in 2019 was 47.5 years old. This question is posed as a standard demographic question, yet it is also important as speaks to the current and future state of the legal linguistic environment. Noting age may highlight multilingualism trends among age groups. For example, if multilingualism is more prominent in the younger lawyers, then the projection of multilingual representation would be positive. However, if multilingual tendencies are clustered among older lawyers, then this study may serve to highlight needed points of improvement in the legal system in an increasingly multilingual society.</p>

<p>Other (please specify)</p>

<hr />

<p>Gender identification is another standard (multiple choice) demographic question, however, it is useful to gather this data check whether the August 2020 American trend of men outnumbering women (especially in leadership), is replicated in and persistent in the Caribbean country of Saint Lucia [americanbar.org] [clio.com/resources][attorneyatwork.com]. There may also be a need to highlight if there are any differences in linguistics interests among the lawyers. Females are often believed to be more capable of and interested in linguistic acquisition and practice. Data gathered could confirm or dispute this assumption.</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>Which of the following best describe (s) your ethnicity/race?</em></li>
</ul>

<p>American Indian/Alaska Native/Amerindian (Native Caribbean People)</p>

<p>Black/African/Afro-Caribbean</p>

<p>White/North European</p>

<p>Mediterranean (Greek, Italian, Turkish, Syrian, etc.)</p>

<p>Hispanic/ Latino (Mexican, Central or South American, or other Spanish or Portuguese etc.)</p>

<p>Indian subcontinent</p>

<p>SE Asian/Chinese/Native Hawaiian/ Other Pacific Islander</p>

<p>Mixed parentage</p>

<p>While the ABA noted that “most state bars and state licensing agencies do not track race and ethnicity in the profession”, in 2020 there was an increase in this type of data collection [americanbar.org] [clio.com/resources] [attorneyatwork.com]. As of 2010, only 11.4% of all American lawyers were men and women of color, and this only rose to 14.1% in 2020 [americanbar.org] [clio.com/resources][attorneyatwork.com]. In developed countries, like America, it is said that minorities remain underrepresented in the legal profession; however, there is limited information on the legal environment of the Caribbean-an environment where the majority of the population would historically be non-white. As of the 2010 Saint Lucian census, the “ethnic group” of 
“African Descents” represented about 85.28 percent of the population (the highest); this was distantly followed by the “Mixed” category with 10.85 percent, and the “East Indian” at 2.16 percent [census2010].</p>

<p>Additionally, one’s household and upbringing may shape or influence one’s interests. Multiculturalism is quite prevalent in the Caribbean, however, one’s multilingualism might be impacted by one’s upbringing. While formal education may be a primary factor in one’s language acquisition, various states of immigration over generations, or other forms of diversity in one’s household, might influence their linguistic capacities.
Identifying participant ethnicity/race is another standard demographic inquiry, nevertheless, it is needed here to highlight if there are any differences in linguistics interests among the lawyers based on their backgrounds.</p>
