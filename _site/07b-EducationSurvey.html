<h3 id="introduction">Introduction:</h3>

<p>As of October 2021, Saint Lucian educational statistics noted that that there were 25840 students, 2015 teachers, and 1644 trained teachers  (missing reference); however, no information currently exists on the language capabilities of teachers in an increasingly multilingual environment. The importance of language diversity and vitality in society was recently highlighted in the observance of the 2021 International Mother Language Day. The theme for this annual UNESCO celebration (typically held on February 21st) was “Fostering Multilingualism for Inclusion in Education And Society” <a class="citation" href="#joseph_2021">(Joseph, 2021)</a>. It focused on the significance of an ‘individual’s first language, indigenous language, native language emphasizing that instruction of such languages should begin in the early years”. This theme was said to be the impetus for further development of the Saint Lucian Nation Language Policy, and can also support efforts to monitor, preserve, and examine this language <a class="citation" href="#joseph_2021">(Joseph, 2021)</a>.</p>

<p>Therefore, I am currently attempting to utilize surveys and data science tools to investigate and establish foundational truths about the linguistic environment in Saint Lucia, with particular attention to the vitality status of the local heritage language of Saint Lucian Creole (Antillean Creole/ Kwéyòl/ Patois/ Patwa). These surveys will be executed with close consideration of the articles present in the ‘Charter on Language Policy and Language Rights in the Creole-Speaking Caribbean’ <a class="citation" href="#icclr_2011">(ICCLR, 2011; Harris, 2011; Pousada, 2011)</a>. Conducting a series of surveys will not only aid my educational pursuits but will also serve to bolster the execution of the upcoming Saint Lucian national language policy <a class="citation" href="#camdu_st_lucia_national_2021">(Lucia, 2021; CAMDU, 2018; of Education, 2017; Satney, 2021; Harris, 2011; of Education, 2021; Joseph, 2021)</a>. This survey will focus on the crucial providers of education in Saint Lucia.</p>

<h3 id="goals">Goals:</h3>

<p>This undertaking will finally enact Carrington’s wishes from 1999 <a class="citation" href="#Carrington1999">(Carrington, 1999)</a> - the creation of quantifiable data on the current status of the language, by investigating its usage among some of the most crucial members of Saint Lucia’s labor force. The work of teachers, medical workers, lawyers, and law enforcement, are valuable to this study as they are respected pillars of society whose tasks typically require frequent interaction with the Saint Lucian public. It is hoped that this quantifiable data will aid in allocating teaching and learning language resources to these crucial members of society; perhaps the subsequent association of Kwéyòl with these respected professions will assist in its recognition and elevation<a class="citation" href="#hutchinson_1998">(Hutchinson, 1998)</a>. I am inclined to believe that connecting Kwéyòl with elite members of society may be yet another necessary step towards recognizing it as an official language of Saint Lucia.</p>

<p>As of September 2021, the Ministry of Education, Sustainable Development, Innovation, Science, Technology and Vocational Training hosted an online National Language Policy Implementation Planning Conference through the Curriculum and Materials Development Unit (CAMDU) <a class="citation" href="#satney_2021">(Satney, 2021; Lucia, 2021)</a>. The updated policy was stated to have four main goals for Kwéyòl; to recognize it as an official language, to utilize it as a language of instruction, that all students should become bilingual upon primary school completion, and that students will become bi-literate upon secondary school completion <a class="citation" href="#joseph_2021">(Joseph, 2021)</a>.</p>

<p>Notably, during the conference, Professor Hubert Devonish provided an impassioned discussion on the difference between national language policy and an education language policy, and also highlighted the importance of ‘The Charter on Language Policy and Language Rights in the Creole-speaking Caribbean’. Professor Hazel Simmons-McDonald Evidence-Basedementing Kwéyòl Instruction’ using ‘Evidence Based Approaches’; she noted that integrating Kwéyòl in the classroom may assist with improving student’s ability to grab crucial concepts and that observing teachers’ Kwéyòl competency levels may support this effort.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the goal of the current National Language Policy would be to ensure full literacy in Kwéyòl ”. It was reported that CAMDU Specialists, working on a language policy for the teaching of the Kwéyòl language in schools on the island, are hoping to have the completed implementation plan and already formulated draft policy presented to the Government of Saint Lucia by January of 2022 <a class="citation" href="#satney_2021">(Satney, 2021)</a>. Mention was made the ongoing works to survey crucial members of society and their roles in the linguistic environment of Saint Lucia <a class="citation" href="#language_survey_mention_2021">(Edu Saint Lucia Plus, 2021; Satney, 2021)</a>.</p>

<p>Thus far, all of these attempts have been pivotal yet incremental steps towards raising the status of the Kwéyòl language. Unfortunately, it has yet to become recognized as an official language of the country, nor is it recognized by most modern translation systems. Language death can be associated with language shifts where an ethnic group’s members no longer learn their heritage language as their first language; these surveys are at the very least are geared towards determining if Kwéyòl is still being used as a first language on the island <a class="citation" href="#maffi2002endangered">(Maffi, 2002; Edwards, 2003; Tonkin et al., 2003)</a>. Overall, these past efforts highlight the crucial need to quantify, monitor, and digitize the language to effectively preserve it for future generations.</p>

<h3 id="methodology">Methodology:</h3>

<p>By clicking the submit button, I agree to the terms &amp; conditions:</p>

<p>Participation Consent Agreement:</p>

<p>This demographic and linguistic research study has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Harrisburg University of Science and Technology (HU). This research study is led by Laurel Lord, a Ph. D. candidate in Data Science Department at HU. The faculty advisors for this study are Dr. Kayla Jordan, Assistant Professor of Social Analytics, and Mark Newman, Corporate Faculty of Analytics.</p>

<p>This study is being conducted in compliance with the standards and guidelines given by the HU IRB. The Collaborative Institution Training Initiative (CITI) Programme has certified the researcher, Laurel Lord, for human-subject research.</p>

<p>Purpose of the Study:</p>

<p>The purpose of this research is to gather general demographic data of Saint Lucian medical professionals and identify their patterns of linguistic interactions with the public on the multilingual island of Saint Lucia. There will be a specific focus on the second most prevalent language - Saint Lucian Creole (Kwéyòl, Patois, Patwa). The responses of participants will be run through textual analytical tools to provide insight into the medical environment that Saint Lucians, particularly Kwéyòl speakers, experience.</p>

<p>Participant Tasks:</p>

<p>Each participant is asked to fill out an anonymous online survey to provide their basic demographic details, statements on their multilingual capacities, and statements on the language diversity of patient interactions. The form contains ten (10) questions that each participant should be able to complete in less than twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Participant Risks and Discomforts:</p>

<p>There is no anticipated risk for the participant in this research. All information will be protected, and the confidentiality of the data will be maintained throughout this research.</p>

<p>Survey Benefits:</p>

<p>The collection of profession-specific labour statistical data is uncommon in Saint Lucia. Additionally, there appears to be low societal consideration of the increasing multilingual environment; therefore, data collection and analysis of this specific profession could serve as a template for job-specific data collection and improve the medical care offered to the inhabitants of Saint Lucia.</p>

<p>Participation is Voluntary:</p>

<p>Survey participation is voluntary, and individuals may choose not to participate if uncomfortable with answering any of the questions after signing the consent form; this can be done by withdrawing from the survey at any time without penalty. To withdraw, close the form window without hitting the “Submit” button.</p>

<p>Participant Compensation:</p>

<p>There is no compensation for participation as this research will be distributed internally by the St. Lucia Medical and Dental Association.</p>

<p>Privacy/Confidentiality/Data Security:</p>

<p>Based on the survey’s design, there is no overt identifying material being collected; there is no data on one’s exact location, email addresses, phone numbers, or government-issued personal identification numbers. All submitted data will be gathered into a password-protected main document. This data will be saved on a standard thumb drive for three years after the publication of the report.</p>

<p>Non-identifiable data, and a report, will be submitted to the St. Lucia Medical and Dental Association. The Central Statistical Office of Saint Lucia, and the Saint Lucia Folk Research Centre (FRC).</p>

<p>Enquires/Questions:</p>

<p>Any questions may be directed to Laurel Lord at lalord@my.harrisburgu.edu. Questions or concerns regarding your rights as a subject in this study may be directed to HU IRB via 717-901-5100 or their website at harrisburgu.edu/irb.</p>

<p><em>Question Design:</em></p>

<p>Demographic questions included questions on Age, Gender (with the option to self-describe), Ethnicity/Race (with the option to self-describe), and Highest Level of Education as those may add additional context to one’s linguistic background; the list of Ethnicity/Race options was inspired by historical settlement data specific to the region, as well as recent immigration data <a class="citation" href="#pm_slu_citizenship_2015">(PM, 2015; Team, 2021; CIP, 2020)</a>. An enquiry is also made about one’s Citizenship, as this may give additional details as to whether locals or foreign nationals are more likely to be exposed to diverse linguistic backgrounds that benefit the teaching field.</p>

<p>Questions into the number of years one has been employed by the Saint Lucian Government as a teacher, level(s) of education taught, and courses taught may reflect one’s experiences and one’s likelihood of exposure to multilingual situations; salary questions may speak to possible future incentives for utilising or acquiring additional language skills. Location details on the current teaching districts of participants may also reveal details about language hotspots on the island (missing reference); which locations might have high numbers of certain languages, as well as reflect the number of teachers capable of addressing those needs.</p>

<p>Linguistic questions enquired into participant awareness of non-English language assistance programmes in their work environment, if multilinguals’ skills were ever a useful asset, and if they perceived language barriers while executing their required tasks; it is hoped that such data could lead to improved training on currently available resources, or inspire improved resource allocation towards language needs.</p>

<p>Like the list of Ethnicity/Race options, language list options were inspired by historical settlement data specific to the region, and recent immigration and tourism data <a class="citation" href="#pm_slu_citizenship_2015">(PM, 2015; Team, 2021; CIP, 2020)</a>. Options were included for survey participants that may have encountered various forms of sign language, languages that were not represented within the scope of the survey, and languages that they could not readily identify (‘unrecognised languages’).</p>

<p>Additionally, linguistic questions focused on gathering details on one’s first language, and if they spoke additional languages. There was also a focus on the frequency with which one encountered various languages; this was an attempt to see if the current language environment truly reflected historical settlement, immigration, and tourism data. It is hoped that the information gathered from these questions may better enable the resource allocation to the language needs of works and the people they serve.</p>

<h4 id="future-works">Future Works:</h4>

<p>Ultimately, the survey may not be perfect and may have room for improvement in the future. It is hoped that these works will serve as a template for annual assessments moving forward. With the current iteration, the window for describing linguistic experiences was deliberately not rigid; it allowed participants to consider and comment on relevant linguistic experiences encountered throughout the entirety of their professional life. To avoid overlapping data points in the future, the next survey interval will need to be about a year from the last launch; this would allow better annual trend tracking of these professionals’ experiences. Future studies may include surveying other educators that may not be directly employed by the local government.</p>
