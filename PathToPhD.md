## Path to Ph.D.:



### Starting Point: 

Background: 

YCP BA; minors in HR, finance, and accounting.

YCP MBA business science (Lean, Six Sigma, etc.)

Worked as Process Engineer, HRIS, etc.

HU Masters in Analytics: Case study Data analysis - Spanish language acquisition and pedagogy. This work entailed a literature review on Spanish linguistics, a comparison of current language learning technologies and techniques; a new method (inspired by the Guidonian hand mnemonic device) was conceptualized, tested, data collected, analyzed, and the results were visualized using R.


### Ideas for Ph.D.:

1.  ~~Gamification of linguistics:~~

    * Language acquisition in a VR environment/ an exploration of online learning environments.*

    * Road blocks= Spoke to Ford and five other teachers. There was partial positive feedback but not full support from Dr. Ford. No traction/it did not appear to fit for a Ph.D. in data science.*


2.  ~~Projects of cultural and environmental significance:~~

    * Conservation via the collection and monitoring of data related to animals and humans; deep learning related to entity identification - animal acoustics and noise pollution, and monitoring endangered languages.*

    * Road blocks= Spoke to Ford. There was partial positive feedback but not full support from Dr. Ford. While I was able to find external support I was unable to find internal support members; unable to form a committee from HU members. No traction/it did not appear to fit for a Ph.D. in data science.*


3.  ~~Projects related to understanding language vitality:~~

    * Exploring the need for a census-type survey to curate a language dataset, to assess the state of vitality/state of endangerment or extinction  (since none were attempted since the 1970s).*

    * Road blocks= Spoke to Ford. While I was able to find external support, I was unable to find internal support members; unable to form a committee from HU members. No traction/it did not appear to fit for a Ph.D. in data science.*


4.  ~~Index creation:~~

    * Utilizing sentiment analysis and Tripadvisor reviews to create a new factor (visitor perception) that can be combined with other existing standard factors when calculating a country's ranking. This would explore the sentiments concerning a tourist's experience, as well as seek the reasoning why they chose the destination; is this due to eco-tourism, health tourism,  poverty tourism, etc.?*

    * Road blocks= Spoke to Ford. There was partial positive feedback but not support from Dr. Ford. I was unable to find internal support members; unable to form a committee from HU members. No traction/it did not appear to fit for a Ph.D. in data science.*


5.  ~~Presented on using data science for environmental analysis with index creation:~~

    * Proposed and presented a multi-paper mixture of sound and sentiment analysis to HU members.*

Road blocks= Spoke to Ford, Ashby, Arvid, and five other teachers. While I was able to find external support, there was no additional internal support; unable to form a committee. No traction/it did not appear to fit for a Ph.D. in data science; was advised to focus more on business or tourism, or anything I had a background in, or focusing on one area (not a multi-paper publication route).*


6.  ~~Began to focus solely on acoustic analysis:~~

    * Attempted to evaluate the current acoustic methods of tracking endangered species and noise pollution.
Road blocks= While I was able to find external support from Cornell, there was no additional internal support; unable to form a committee from HU members. It did not appear to be fit for a Ph.D. in data science.*


7.  ~~Explored Traumatic Brain injury and language retention/acquisition as a recommendation from Dr. Ford:~~

    * This was based on the idea that Maryland would be able to offer worthwhile datasets.
Road blocks= Was not able to access the data right away, yet when data was finally available, it did not appear to be substantial for a Ph.D. in data science.*


8.  Covid pivot- ~~Began focusing on data science pedagogy:~~

    * Some research slowed down as some people had to pivot/redesign their ideas on in-person interaction with test subjects, which was made difficult with the pandemic.*

    * Explored the improvement of data science pedagogy; wanted to create a dissertation surrounding a new framework for teaching data science to address current systematic flaws. One idea focused on utilizing Maslow's hierarchy of needs as inspiration for ethical data science projects; explored the topics of digital humanities and biocultural diversity. Noted that there was an increase in the mention of Maslow's hierarchy of needs in various fields during the pandemic; wanted to explore topics inspired by each level of the hierarchy, or how a topic could be classified into that hierarchy.*

    * Road blocks= There was partial internal support from Dr. Ford but was unable to find internal support members; unable to form a committee from HU members. No traction/it did not appear to fit for a Ph.D. in data science.*


9.  ~~Using Maslow's need for safety and security, and the lens of linguistics created an association between linguistics and crime; thought I could add to the data science field through data curation and analysis:~~

    * Wanted to create an NLP project on legal phrase detection; hoped to use entity (phrase) detection to predict success in court; also wanted to convert existing linguistic vitality survey to an online survey (a demographic and linguistic census-type survey of lawyers where an endangered language is spoken, and how their linguistic capacities helped or hindered client representation).*

    * Road blocks= Spoke to Purcell, Ashby, and Ford. There was partial internal support from Dr. Ford; there was some traction but, he mentioned focusing more on sentiment analysis, and using the language as a background for the dataset. Unable to form a committee from HU members. It did not appear to be fit for a Ph.D. in data science.*


10.  Current state: 

Delving into NLP and Machine translation and sentiment analysis:

Currently exploring Cross-Lingual Sentiment Analysis; using LIWC with Machine Translation.

Access is available to labeled dictionary dataset, and various works of literature in the target language.
