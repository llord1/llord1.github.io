<h3 id="introduction">Introduction:</h3>

<p>The purpose of this paper is to gather general demographic data of lawyers and identify patterns of linguistic legal representation on the multilingual island of Saint Lucia. There will be a specific focus on the second most prevalent language - “Saint Lucian Kwéyòl”. The responses of participants will be run through textual analytical tools to provide insight into the legal environment that Saint Lucians, particularly Kwéyòl speakers, experience.</p>

<h3 id="literature-review">Literature Review:</h3>

<p>Lack of labor demographic and linguistic data in Saint Lucia:</p>

<p>Several careers in society can contribute to the general sense of safety and security that Maslow has referred to in his famous hierarchy of needs. However, obvious yet often overlooked issues in communication can mean the difference between life and death in fields of practice such as medicine and law enforcement. Therefore, thoughtful data collection and monitoring of these crucial services can enhance and optimize their performance.</p>

<p>Thoughtful deliberation of linguistics, particularly consideration of language barriers, is increasing in the medical field. As recently as 2019, Sweden conducted a national study on health care professionals’ communications through interpreters; this study occurred after noting that many parents utilizing neonatal care were foreign-born and unable to effectively communicate with the healthcare professionals in the local language <a class="citation" href="#patriksson2019health">(Patriksson et al., 2019)</a>. In 2013, linguistic work had been done to highlight communications issues between physicians and Spanish-speaking Latin American women with pelvic floor disorders <a class="citation" href="#sevilla2013communication">(Sevilla et al., 2013)</a>; this study highlighted that apart from patients’ lack of disease understanding, there was a lack of Spanish proficiency among the participating physicians. Another 2013 qualitative study conducted on linguistics, centered around the perceptions of patient-provider communication in breast and cervical cancer-related care when dealing with low-income English and Spanish-speaking women <a class="citation" href="#simon2013perceptions">(Simon et al., 2013)</a>. In 2009, similar work was conducted on competent peer support intervention for Spanish-speaking Latinas with breast cancer <a class="citation" href="#napoles2009developing">(Nápoles-Springer et al., 2009)</a>. 
Questioning the possible ties of linguistics to various professions is not necessarily new, yet few resources are being dedicated to detecting communication issues and improving communication within multilingual countries. More interesting would be the pivot of looking at persons who are already multilingual in a field, and noting if they have sufficient training and resources when their primary language is not the dominant language of the country in which they practice. One study did investigate Spanish–English bilingual psychotherapists and their Personal and professional language development and use <a class="citation" href="#verdinelli2009spanish">(Verdinelli &amp; Biever, 2009)</a>. Another study observed instances where nurses double as interpreters (a study of Spanish-speaking patients in a U.S. primary care setting) <a class="citation" href="#elderkin2001nurses">(Elderkin-Thompson et al., 2001)</a>.</p>

<p>While data collection on the various professions can be conducted by private companies, it is typically undertaken by government-backed labor agencies, to ensure that the data is freely available to the public. In America, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics collects such data and hosts it on a public website <a class="citation" href="#BLS2020">(BLS, 2020)</a>. While not all developing nations have been able to dedicate resources to the close monitoring of this data, its value is increasingly recognized.</p>

<p>While the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics provides general information on the demographics of the lawyers in the country, the American Bar Association (ABA) gathers more detailed information on Legal Profession Statistics <a class="citation" href="#aba_2020">(ABA, 2020; BLS, 2020)</a>. Their current statistical data assisted with research on lawyers and the legal profession. Their website notes data on the topics of lawyer demographics (including matters of disability, women, and minority/people of color). It also encompasses justice system statistics (including topics on public perception of justice system/lawyers and the justice system), court statistics (including cases filed, and criminal justice statistics). this association also notes the topics of law students and education and legal salaries (and related attrition/retention data).</p>

<p>Currently, lawyer demographics in Saint Lucia (SLU) do not appear to be centrally gathered. The 2016 Labour Force Survey, made publicly available by The Central Statistical Office of SLU, did inquire into participants’ industry - “What is the name of the business where you/……. work? What type of activity is carried on there?” <a class="citation" href="#govtSLU_Labour_2017">(govt.lc, 2017)</a>. However, the dataset ultimately appears to have been simplified to the point where details on individual professions were rendered indiscernible. The closest response, related to lawyers, would be one that highlighted “professional, scientific and technical activities”; this made up 1.0%  (51 participants) of the survey. A representative of The Central Statistical Office of SLU stated that the data in the country’s 2016 Labour Force Survey was “not disaggregated in such a way to get a count of all lawyers” <a class="citation" href="#govtSLU_Labour_2017">(govt.lc, 2017)</a>. It was also stated that since the 2016 Labour Force Survey “utilizes a sample if it were to give a figure it would not be representative” <a class="citation" href="#govtSLU_Labour_2017">(govt.lc, 2017)</a>. Ultimately, even the president of the Bar Association of SLU, also confirmed that she was unaware of the departments of government bearing statistical data specific to lawyers.</p>

<p>Saint Lucia’s National Environmental Information System (NEIS)  has been one of the latest governmental attempts at collecting and organizing national data <a class="citation" href="#govtSLU_NEIS_2019">(govt.lc, 2019)</a>, <a class="citation" href="#govtSLU_NEIS">(neis.govt.lc, 2020)</a>, <a class="citation" href="#govtSLUdata">(govt.lc, 2020)</a>. This “Project Reporting System for Multilateral Environmental Agreement (MEA) Implementation and Environmental Information Management” is regarded as a “legal instrument with binding effects on countries that have agreed to become parties” <a class="citation" href="#govtSLU_NEIS">(neis.govt.lc, 2020)</a>. Saint Lucia’s participation in this international agreement, enhances global agreements and sustainable development projects moving forward. However, one current category that highlights the “employed labor force by industry”, is classified as having a low priority level.</p>

<p>A need for additional data regarding lawyer demographics in Saint Lucia has been identified. To address this need, while following social distancing protocols, an online survey has been selected as the tool of data collection. Ultimately, such a survey can be applied to lawyers, nurses, or police officers - any profession that requires direct extended interaction with a citizen to provide a sense of safety and security.</p>

<h3 id="the-saint-lucian-digital-environment-and-survey-instruments">The Saint Lucian digital environment and survey instruments:</h3>

<p>Data collection via surveys is virtually challenging to conduct anywhere. However, in developing nations, limited access to various forms of infrastructure provides additional obstructions. And yet, due to the pandemic of 2020, infrastructure, particularly digital infrastructure, in many countries rapidly evolved as they rallied to keep essential services functional. Saint Lucia’s improved telecommunications environment does provide an ideal setting for attempting online data collection; a comprehensive survey on the vitality of the language.</p>

<p>Surveying in the Caribbean:</p>

<p>One paper cited at least three major challenges to conducting surveys in the Caribbean <a class="citation" href="#tindigarukayo2001challenges">(Tindigarukayo, 2001)</a>. Firstly, it stated there were issues with meager sampling frames from which to select representative samples (especially when sampling noninstitutionalized populations. Secondly, administering various survey instruments was difficult; mailers were challenging due to unreliable postal systems, telephone interviews would be inherently biased due to limited access to telecommunication infrastructure and devices, and local pockets of crime made in-person interviews problematic. Thirdly, effectively surveying these areas of much inherent cultural and linguistic diversity would be challenging. However, since the publication of that paper in 2001, the conditions of telecommunications have improved in Caribbean countries such as Saint Lucia.</p>

<p>Technological changes:</p>

<p>The 2020 pandemic motivated the island nation of Saint Lucia to launch efforts to ensure that students could interact with teachers and access educational materials by creating policies to supply teachers and households of school-age students with internet-accessible electronic devices. From 2013 through 2014, computers were acquired and distributed by the local government; in 2014 the Venezuelan government donated 7000 computers to students from forms three and four islandwide <a class="citation" href="#cng_media_2020">(Media, 2020; “7,000 more free laptops for secondary school students,” 2014)</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, since the 2007 rekindling of the relationship between the governments of Taiwan and Saint Lucia (missing reference), Taiwan has strived to facilitate improved access to telecommunication services. In 2015, these two planned for a “Government Islandwide Network (GiNet) Project” to produce affordable and high-quality internet (wifi), delivered via 70 hotspots <a class="citation" href="#neptune_2015">(Neptune, 2015)</a>. With a focus on youths in need, Taiwan has also donated multiple laptops, projectors, and educational interactive television equipment over the years, and as of 2021 enhanced the “GiNet project” <a class="citation" href="#digital_2018">(Digital, 2018; Charles-Soomer &amp; Edwin, 2018; Antoine, 2019; Alexander, 2019; “GINet prepares to launch Phase 2 of the project,” 2019; Media, 2020; Leonce, 2021; News, 2021)</a>. At a brief ceremony, on the 16th of March 2021, the governments of Saint Lucia and Taiwan collaborated to declare continued work on a total of 91 wireless access points being deployed using “Sector and Omnidirectional antennae”; each wireless access point offering coverage to “approximately 50 users” simultaneously, and the sector antennae bearing a “120-degree coverage and the range of each device is around 150Ft” <a class="citation" href="#SLUtimesnews_2021">(News, 2021)</a>.</p>

<p>One could feasibly assume that these drastic changes in the telecommunications environment would mean that much of the population has increasingly gained access to digital technology <a class="citation" href="#cso_2011">(CSO, 2011)</a>. This access to technology serves as a boon to online surveying as this virtually reduces most of the obstacles that are typically presented in this setting.</p>

<h3 id="methodology">Methodology:</h3>

<p><a href="https://form.jotform.com/203134599286160">See draft online form</a>.</p>

<p>May attempt using the Chi-square test of independence for the following survey questions.</p>

<p><em>Survey question design</em></p>

<p>1.a  Please indicate which of the following best describe (s) you. *</p>

<p>Age:</p>

<p>Less than 18</p>

<p>18-24</p>

<p>25-29</p>

<p>30-34</p>

<p>35-39</p>

<p>40-44</p>

<p>45-49</p>

<p>50-54</p>

<p>55-59</p>

<p>60-64</p>

<p>65-69</p>

<p>70 -74</p>

<p>75 or older</p>

<p>Prefer not to respond</p>

<p>The age range (multiple choice) was based on the ABA data that indicates lawyers typically obtain higher education levels beyond high school and remain in practice past the age of 65 [source]; the median age of all U.S. workers was 42.3 years old, yet very few lawyers are younger than 25 and the median age for U.S. lawyers in 2019 was 47.5 years old. This question is posed as a standard demographic question, yet it is also important as speaks to the current and future state of the legal linguistic environment. Noting age may highlight multilingualism trends among age groups. For example, if multilingualism is more prominent in the younger lawyers, then the projection of multilingual representation would be positive. However, if multilingual tendencies are clustered among older lawyers, then this study may serve to highlight needed points of improvement in the legal system in an increasingly multilingual society.</p>

<p>1.b Gender:</p>

<p>Man</p>

<p>Woman</p>

<p>Prefer not to respond</p>

<p>1.c Gender identification is another standard (multiple choice) demographic question, however, it is useful to gather this data to check whether the August 2020 American trend of men outnumbering women (especially in leadership), is replicated in and persistent in the Caribbean country of Saint Lucia <a class="citation" href="#ABA2020Profile">(Association, 2020; Clio, 2020; Ernde, 2019)</a>. There may also be a need to highlight if there are any differences in linguistics interests among the lawyers. Females are often believed to be more capable of and interested in linguistic acquisition and practice. Data gathered could confirm or dispute this assumption.</p>

<p>1.c Citizenship:</p>

<p>Jus sanguinis (right of blood)</p>

<p>Jus soli (right of birthplace)</p>

<p>Naturalization</p>

<p>Non-citizen</p>

<p>Prefer not to respond</p>

<p>Citizenship status might indicate a history or lineage of commitment to, and familiarity with, the culture, language, people, and overall development of the country. At the very least it may indicate a legal tie to their practice’s environment.</p>

<p>1.d Ethnicity/race</p>

<p>American Indian/Alaska Native</p>

<p>Black/African/Afro-Caribbean</p>

<p>East Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Okinawan, Taiwanese, Tibetan, etc.)</p>

<p>Hispanic/Latino/Spanish Origin (Portuguese, Mexican, Central or South American, Cuban, Puerto Rican, etc.)</p>

<p>Indian Subcontinent/South Asia (Afghan, Bangladeshis, Bhutanese, Indian, Maldivians, Nepali, Pakistani, and Sri Lankan, etc.)</p>

<p>Middle Eastern and North African (Algerian, Bahrain, Lebanese, Arab, Moroccan, Syrian, Yemeni, etc.)</p>

<p>Mixed Parentage (two or more races)</p>

<p>Native Hawaiian/ Other Pacific Islander (Native Hawaiian, Samoan, Guamanian or Chamorro, Fijian, Tongan, Marshallese, etc.)</p>

<p>South East Asian (Bruneian, Burmese, Cambodian, Filipino, Hmong, Indonesian, Laotian, Malaysian, Mien, Singaporean, Timorese, Thai, Vietnamese, etc.)</p>

<p>White/North European</p>

<p>Not known</p>

<p>Prefer not to respond</p>

<p>While the ABA noted that “most state bars and state licensing agencies do not track race and ethnicity in the profession”, in 2020, this type of data collection increased <a class="citation" href="#ABA2020Profile">(Association, 2020)</a>, <a class="citation" href="#clio_2020">(Clio, 2020)</a>, <a class="citation" href="#AttorneyAtWork_2019">(Ernde, 2019)</a>. As of 2010, only 11.4% of all American lawyers were men and women of color, and this only rose to 14.1% in 2020 <a class="citation" href="#ABA2020Profile">(Association, 2020)</a>, <a class="citation" href="#clio_2020">(Clio, 2020)</a>, <a class="citation" href="#AttorneyAtWork_2019">(Ernde, 2019)</a>. In developed countries, like America, it is said that minorities remain underrepresented in the legal profession; however, there is limited information on the legal environment of the Caribbean-an environment where the majority of the population would historically be non-white. As of the 2010 Saint Lucian census, the “ethnic group” of 
“African Descents” represented about 85.28 percent of the population (the highest); this was distantly followed by the “Mixed” category with 10.85 percent, and the “East Indian” at 2.16 percent <a class="citation" href="#CSO_SLU2010">(CSO, 2020)</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, one’s household and upbringing may shape or influence one’s interests. Multiculturalism is quite prevalent in the Caribbean, however, one’s multilingualism might be impacted by one’s upbringing. While formal education may be a primary factor in one’s language acquisition, various states of immigration over generations, or other forms of diversity in one’s household, might influence their linguistic capacities.
Identifying participant ethnicity/race is another standard demographic inquiry, nevertheless, it is needed here to highlight if there are any differences in linguistics interests among the lawyers based on their backgrounds.</p>

<p>Lawyers may choose to focus on different areas of the law. The cliental they encounter may be influenced by this specialization. Inquiring into one’s area of specialization will highlight which areas of the law may be associated with a need to speak multiple languages; more specifically, which areas of the law in Saint Lucia are more likely to require an understanding of  Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language.</p>

<p>An additional means of narrowing down underlying multilinguistic tendencies in this field is to inquire into one’s areas of practice. St. Lucia is a sovereign island nation in the Commonwealth of Nations but, because Saint Lucia was both a French and English colony before it gained independence on the 22nd of February, 1979, the legal system has been a mix of civil and English common law (missing reference).</p>

<p>Based on one’s average salary per case, there could be an argument for the economic reinforcement of certain linguistic standards. It may be interesting to note if a multilingual can request and acquire more money due to their linguistic abilities. The Average Attorney Salary of a lawyer located in the sister island country of Dominica is around 2,950 XCD per month <a class="citation" href="#DOMsalary">(salaryexplorer.com, 2020)</a>. It is said that salaries range from 1,360 XCD (lowest) to 4,680 XCD (highest). Yet, according to salaryexplorer.com, a Saint Lucian  Attorney typically earns around 5,500 XCD per month;  this is with salaries ranging from 2,530 XCD (lowest) to 8,750 XCD (highest). It should be noted that Saint Lucia’s minimum wage rate was last changed at the beginning of 2013, yet it stands at XCD 300 a month for office clerks, XCD 200 for shop assistants, and XCD 160 for messengers according to minimum-wage.org <a class="citation" href="#SLU2020wages">(minimum-wage.org, 2020)</a>.</p>

<p>This question concerning student debt is typical of the ABA but has been adjusted for a Saint Lucian setting. It may indicate if this career path is indeed lucrative for the students, thus somewhat gauging the stability of the industry.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Please indicate if your workplace directly offers any formal foreign language assistance programs to clients.</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes, an internal service is available to clients.</p>

<p>No, an external service would be recommended (for example, a court-appointed interpreter).</p>

<p>Prefer not to respond.</p>

<p>This question would confirm the presence of legal aid in Saint Lucia. It would simultaneously confirm the lawyers’ awareness of the availability of this service.</p>

<p>This question seeks to understand the current and demand for multilingualism in lawyering, based on past demand. These details may reveal sufficiencies as well as insufficiencies concerning the adequate legal representation of  Saint Lucian clients. Saint Lucia is a multilingual country, and a lawyer with multiple languages may stand a better chance of not only attracting a diverse and numerous clientele base; reduced language barriers would allow lawyers to better relay facts, arguments, and sentiments of clients with diverse backgrounds.</p>

<p>Understanding where and how one engages in language learning might highlight environments that foster multilingualism in lawyers. The learning of certain languages may take place in formal and informal settings. In Saint Lucia, most language education would likely be done in a formal school setting. Overall, the national heritage language of this island would typically be learned informally. Saint Lucian Kwéyòl only recently began being formally taught to young children (between the ages of 6-12) in less than a handful of schools, and adult learners; however, since the major fire at the National Folk Resource Center, most classes have reverted to more private sessions.</p>

<p>10b. Please indicate which technique best describes how you came to learn each of the aforementioned languages; please select all that apply.</p>

<p>This question is one of the most crucial to this study. English is listed as it is indeed the main language spoken (a prestige language) in Saint Lucia. Apart from modern English, legal (and medical) professionals can claim to be multilingual based on their foundational studies of Latin; placing this detail acknowledges this field facet. Saint Lucian Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/Patios) is inquired about, as it is the heritage language of the island. French and Spanish are inquired about as they are common language offerings at all high schools on the island. Dutch, and Portuguese, and to a lesser extent Hindi and Gaelige/Irish, are other common languages to the rest of the Caribbean due to colonialization and indentured labor. Japanese is taught in Saint Lucia by humanitarian volunteers as part of their Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) work <a class="citation" href="#kobayashi_2020">(Kobayashi, 2020)</a>. Due to an increased presence of Chinese investors and tourists in the Caribbean, and general funding of local projects by China, one’s ability to understand Mandarin is becoming increasingly valuable.</p>

<p>The column category “understand” was added to account for the possible occurrence of receptive bilingualism among lawyers in the Caribbean. This consideration is valid as multilingualism is prevalent in this region; persons here may encounter various languages, yet have been unable to effectively respond. The presence of a “prestige” language, such as English, may draw speakers away from heritage languages;  these heritage languages can suffer from dropping numbers of speakers when receptive bilingualism is not followed up with focused efforts.</p>

<p>Since this survey cannot acquire data from past clients, this question aims to address the languages that lawyers commonly encounter. The language one speaks is not guaranteed to be what one will encounter. It will be interesting to note where the client and lawyer languages overlap and where they do not.</p>
