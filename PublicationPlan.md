#### __Publication Plan__

The publication process can be viewed as an essential part of one's Ph.D. solidification in the field. While publications before graduation from a program can at times be difficult, it may be advantageous to attempt this as part of one's ultimate success in the field. A publication plan allows one to market their results to places that are more apt to appreciate one's works; this allows one to ensure that their contributions are better recognized by industry professionals. Some have viewed such publications as providing a powerful and significant indicator for 'scientific career advancement' {% cite giebel_2019 %}; this is particularly important in a highly competitive field.

Based on the level of a literature review I intend to complete concerning the creation of a framework and its application, I intend to publish a view papers/chapters before my final dissertation presentation (as soon as possible). My main target is a recently created publication geared towards data science papers - *Patterns*. It is said to publish

*'...original research in data science, particularly focusing on solutions to the cross-disciplinary problems that all researchers face when dealing with data, and articles about datasets, software code, algorithms, infrastructures, etc., with permanent links to these research outputs'. Patterns also promotes cross-community conversation by publishing opinion pieces and review articles* {% cite patterns_2020 %}. Since I do intend to discuss matters related to computational linguistics, frameworks, and my dissertation's societal value to low-resource languages (biocultural diversity topics), I do believe that this is an appropriate target. 
However, this does not mean that other publishers will be ignored; I am also open to suggestions and changes concerning this matter. I will also review the [](https://www.taaonline.net/textbook-publishers-author-guidelines) Please see below for details on publications currently being considered.
