#### __Publication Plan__

The publication process can be viewed as an essential part of one's Ph.D. solidification in the field. While publications before graduation from a program can at times be difficult, it may be advantageous to attempt this as part of one's ultimate success in the field. A publication plan allows one to market their results to places that are more apt to appreciate one's works; this allows one to ensure that their contributions are better recognized by industry professionals. Some have viewed such publications as providing a powerful and significant indicator for 'scientific career advancement' {% cite giebel_2019 %}; this is particularly important in a highly competitive field.

I am currently collecting multilingual corpora for a low-resource language as part of my ongoing dissertation work. This endeavor entails the collection of a few documents from the government such as the Saint Lucian national anthem {% cite anthem_2016 %}, speeches from government officials' published press releases bearing Kwéyòl dialogue  {% cite louisy_govt_2004 knowledgewalkinstitute_2021 %}, {% cite louisy_govt_2004 knowledgewalkinstitute_2021 %}, annual financial reports from the country's national bank, poems from national poetry competitions, local folktales published through collaborative efforts of the local government {% cite sil_folktale_1985 %} and SIL International, and a few publicly available creative writing samples from a writing workshop conducted by SIL International {% cite sil_readingbook_1989 %}. 

The SIL International is said to be a faith-based nonprofit organization that visited the country to aided in creating a local dictionary {% cite frank2001kweyol %} for translating a bible (these two works are also publicly accessible). Digital versions of a bible (new testament) {% cite SLUnewtestament_1999 bibleproject_2004 BibleSocieties_2020 %}, an audio version of the bible {% cite audiobible2020 %}, a few documents from the government such as the Saint Lucian national anthem {% cite anthem_2016 %}, governmental speeches bearing Kwéyòl dialogue  {% cite louisy_govt_2004 knowledgewalkinstitute_2021 %},  and works for ministries focused on Kwéyòl activities  {% cite sluFRC_FB_2020 %} are also accessible.

 I also have access to traditional folk songs {% cite joseph_songs_2020 SLU_song_yannucci_2020 %}, discourses {% cite weekes2014bodies frank_1990 %}. Public social media data are also useful, particularly the postings by verified Saint Lucian Kwéyòl writers {% cite kweyol_fb_joseph kweyol_works_joseph kweyol_playlists_joseph%}. There are also Kwéyòl financial document excerpts in the form of Annual Reports from the Saint Lucian National Bank. In 1993 a document entitled "Dances and Songs from a Caribbean Island" was created and in 1996 one named "Select Bibliography of the Literature of the English-speaking West Indies" was also created; if the documents above are insufficient, I will consult these two anthological works for additional data {% cite islandsongs_1993 creolelitlist1996 %}. There are few more books but they are mostly physical documents (I need to finish looking into their digital versions). 

I believe this would be a unique submission as I would compiling all these far-flung works of differing semantic domains and converting them from their various publication formats into analyzable text files. I am currently seeking to publish this data via MDPI or Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute - a publisher of open access scientific journals.

Additionally, based on the level of a literature review I intend to complete, I intend to publish a few chapters before my final dissertation presentation (as soon as possible). My main target is a recently created publication geared towards data science papers - *Patterns*. It is said to publish

*'...original research in data science, particularly focusing on solutions to the cross-disciplinary problems that all researchers face when dealing with data, and articles about datasets, software code, algorithms, infrastructures, etc., with permanent links to these research outputs'. Patterns also promotes cross-community conversation by publishing opinion pieces and review articles* {% cite patterns_2020 %}. Since I do intend to discuss matters related to computational linguistics, frameworks, and my dissertation's societal value to low-resource languages (biocultural diversity topics), I do believe that this is an appropriate target. 

However, this does not mean that other publishers will be ignored; I am also open to suggestions and changes concerning this matter. For example, I have recently become aware of Easychair {% cite easychair2021 %}; it claims to support "a large number of conference models and, judging by our Web traffic, is the world's largest conference management system".

I will also review the [Taaonline's publishers/author's guidelines](https://www.taaonline.net/textbook-publishers-author-guidelines). Please see below for details on publications currently being considered.
