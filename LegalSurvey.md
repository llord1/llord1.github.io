### Introduction:

Obvious yet often overlooked issues in communication can mean the difference between life and death in fields of practice such as medicine and law enforcement. These include police forces, judges, and lawyers, among others. Several careers in society can contribute to the general sense of safety and security that Maslow has referred to in his well-known hierarchy of needs. Therefore, thoughtful data collection and monitoring of these critical services can enhance and optimize their performance. 

### Literature Review:

Lack of labor demographic and linguistic data in Saint Lucia:

Thoughtful deliberation of linguistics, particularly consideration of language barriers, is increasing in the medical field. As recently as 2019, Sweden conducted a national study on health care professionals' communications through interpreters; this study occurred after noting that many parents utilizing neonatal care were foreign-born and unable to effectively communicate with the healthcare professionals in the local language {% cite patriksson2019health %}. In 2013, an investigation highlighted communications issues between physicians and Spanish-speaking Latin American women with pelvic floor disorders {% cite sevilla2013communication %}. That study highlighted that apart from a patient's lack of disease understanding, there was a lack of Spanish proficiency among the participating physicians. Another 2013 qualitative study (conducted on linguistics) centered around the perceptions of patient-provider communication in breast and cervical cancer-related care when dealing with low-income English and Spanish-speaking women {% cite simon2013perceptions %}. In 2009, there was similar work done on a competent peer support intervention for Spanish-speaking Latinas with breast cancer {% cite napoles2009developing %}. 

Questioning the possible ties of linguistics to various professions is not necessarily new, yet few resources have been dedicated to detecting communication issues and improving communication within multilingual countries. An interesting pivot would be the investigation of multilingual professionals and noting if they have sufficient access to language resources, should their primary language not be the dominant language of the country in which they practice. One study did investigate Spanish–English bilingual psychotherapists and their personal and professional language development and use {% cite verdinelli2009spanish %}. Another study observed instances where nurses double as interpreters (a study of Spanish-speaking patients in an American primary care setting) {% cite elderkin2001nurses %}.

While data collection of various professions can be conducted by private companies, it is typically completed by government labor agencies. This undertaking ensures that the results on labor force statistics are freely available to the public. In America, the Bureau of Labor Statistics collects such data and hosts it on a public website {% cite BLS2020 %}. While not all developing nations have been able to dedicate resources to the close monitoring of this data, its value is increasingly recognized.

While the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics provides general information on the demographics of the lawyers in the country, the American Bar Association (ABA) gathers more detailed information on Legal Profession Statistics {% cite aba_2020 BLS2020 %}. Their current statistical data assisted with research on lawyers and the legal profession. Their website notes data on lawyer demographics (including disability, women, and minority/people of color topics). It also encompasses justice system statistics (including public perception of justice system/lawyers and the justice system matters), court statistics (including cases filed and criminal justice statistics). This association also notes the topics of law students and education and legal salaries (and related attrition/retention data).

Currently, the collection of lawyer demographics in Saint Lucia (SLU) are not centralized. The 2016 Labour Force Survey, made publicly available by The Central Statistical Office of SLU, did inquire into a participant's industry - "What is the name of the business where you/....... work? What type of activity is carried on there?" {% cite  govtSLU_Labour_2017 %}. However, the dataset ultimately appears to have been simplified to the point where details on individual professions were rendered indiscernible. The closest response, related to lawyers, would be one that highlighted "professional, scientific and technical activities"; this made up 1.0%  (51 participants) of the survey. A representative of The Central Statistical Office of SLU stated that the data of the 2016 Labour Force Survey was "not disaggregated in such a way to get a count of all lawyers" {% cite govtSLU_Labour_2017 %}. The survey also stated that since the 2016 Labour Force Survey "utilizes a sample if it were to give a figure it would not be representative" {% cite govtSLU_Labour_2017 %}. Ultimately, even the president of the Bar Association of SLU, also confirmed that she was unaware of the departments of government bearing statistical data specific to lawyers.

Saint Lucia's National Environmental Information System (NEIS)  has been one of the latest governmental attempts at collecting and organizing national data {% cite govtSLU_NEIS_2019 %}, {% cite govtSLU_NEIS %}, {% cite govtSLUdata %}. The "Project Reporting System for Multilateral Environmental Agreement (MEA) Implementation and Environmental Information Management" has been regarded as a "legal instrument with binding effects on countries that have agreed to become parties" {% cite govtSLU_NEIS %}. Saint Lucia's participation in this international agreement enhances global agreements and sustainable development projects moving forward. However, one current category that highlights the "employed labor force by industry", is classified as having a low priority level.

A need for additional data regarding lawyer demographics in Saint Lucia has been identified. To address this need, while following social distancing protocols, online surveying was selected as the tool of data collection. Ultimately, such a survey can be applied to lawyers, teachers, nurses, or police officers - any profession that requires direct extended interaction with a citizen to provide a sense of safety and security.

The Saint Lucian digital environment and survey instruments:

Data collection via surveys is virtually challenging to conduct anywhere. However, in developing nations, limited access to various forms of infrastructure provides additional obstructions. One paper cited at least three major challenges to conducting surveys in the Caribbean {% cite tindigarukayo2001challenges %}. Firstly, it stated there were issues with meager sampling frames from which to select representative samples (especially when sampling noninstitutionalized populations). Secondly, administering various survey instruments was difficult; mailers were challenging due to unreliable postal systems, telephone interviews would be inherently biased due to limited access to telecommunication infrastructure and devices, and local pockets of crime made in-person interviews problematic. Thirdly, effectively surveying these areas of much inherent cultural and linguistic diversity would be challenging.

However, difficulties in surveying the population may vary based on occupation, education level, and income level. Due to the nature of their jobs, lawyers are likely to have access to modern communication technologies. While many tasks may involve interacting with archives and records that may not be fully digitized, timely communication is crucial to their work. The recent implementation and utilization of the e-litigation system demonstrate their access and willingness to adapt to new forms of technology. Via online platforms and databases, lawyers can complete online filing of cases and document uploads from any internet-accessible device; the value of this system was highlighted during the pandemic. 

Membership in the Saint Lucia Bar Association provides a central point of communication and information distribution to potential participants. Moreover, the current president of the association, Renee St. Rose, is said to have set a "transformative agenda"; one that welcomes the growth of the country's justice system, and the utilization of various available tools, including technology, to facilitate her goals {% cite morris_2019 %}.

Overall, this work aims to gather general demographic data of lawyers and identify patterns of multilingual legal representation on the multilingual island of Saint Lucia. There will be a specific focus on the second most prevalent language - “Saint Lucian Kwéyòl”. Participant responses will be processed using textual analytical tools to provide insight into the legal environment that Saint Lucians, particularly Kwéyòl speakers, experience.


### Methodology: 

The Legal profession currently heavily uses internet-accessible communication devices provides an apt setting for digital surveys. Jotform.com hosts the online survey as other generic online forms, such as Google Forms or Surveymonkey, had fewer customization offerings. The president of the Saint Lucia Bar Association will facilitate its distribution within the organization. Advertisements with local news and radio stations will not be necessary for promotion.

May attempt using the Chi-square test of independence for the following survey questions.

*Survey question design*


1.  Please indicate which of the following best describe (s) you. 


    1. Age:

Less than 18
    
18-24

25-29

30-34

35-39

40-44

45-49

50-54

55-59
 
60-64

65-69 

70 -74

75 or older

Prefer not to respond

The age range (multiple choice) was based on the ABA data that indicates lawyers typically obtain higher education levels beyond high school and remain in practice past the age of 65 {% cite gaille_2017 %}; the median age of all U.S. workers was 42.3 years old, yet very few lawyers are younger than 25 and the median age for U.S. lawyers in 2019 was 47.5 years old. This question is a standard demographic question; it speaks to the current and future state of the legal linguistic environment. The generalizing effect of age range use is intentional. Requiring one's date of birth and other precise personal details may cause hesitation in a culture that is still aware of and practices {% cite haines_1972 %}.

Noting age may highlight multilingualism trends among age groups. For example, if multilingualism is more prominent in the younger lawyers, then multilingual representation may have a positive projection. However, if multilingual tendencies cluster among older lawyers, this study may highlight the need to improve the legal system in an increasingly multilingual society. 


    2. Gender:

Man

Woman

Prefer not to respond

Gender identification is another standard (multiple choice) demographic question. However, it is valuable to gather this data to check whether the August 2020 American trend of men outnumbering women (especially in leadership), is replicated in and persistent in the Caribbean country of Saint Lucia {%cite ABA2020Profile clio_2020 AttorneyAtWork_2019 %}. There may also be a need to highlight if there are any differences in linguistics interests among the lawyers. Females are often believed to be more capable of and interested in linguistic acquisition and practice. Data gathered could confirm or dispute this assumption.


    3. Citizenship:

Jus sanguinis (right of blood)

Jus soli (right of birthplace)

Naturalization

Non-citizen

Prefer not to respond

Citizenship status might indicate a history or lineage of commitment to, and familiarity with, the culture, language, people, and overall development of the country. At the very least it may indicate a legal tie to their practice's environment.


    4. Ethnicity/race:

American Indian/Alaska Native

Black/African/Afro-Caribbean

East Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Okinawan, Taiwanese, Tibetan, etc.)

Hispanic/Latino/Spanish Origin (Portuguese, Mexican, Central or South American, Cuban, Puerto Rican, etc.)

Indian Subcontinent/South Asia (Afghan, Bangladeshis, Bhutanese, Indian, Maldivians, Nepali, Pakistani, and Sri Lankan, etc.)

Middle Eastern and North African (Algerian, Bahrain, Lebanese, Arab, Moroccan, Syrian, Yemeni, etc.)

Mixed Parentage (two or more races)

Native Hawaiian/ Other Pacific Islander (Native Hawaiian, Samoan, Guamanian or Chamorro, Fijian, Tongan, Marshallese, etc.)

South East Asian (Bruneian, Burmese, Cambodian, Filipino, Hmong, Indonesian, Laotian, Malaysian, Mien, Singaporean, Timorese, Thai, Vietnamese, etc.)

White/North European

Not known

Prefer not to respond

While the ABA noted that "most state bars and state licensing agencies do not track race and ethnicity in the profession", in 2020, this type of data collection increased {%cite ABA2020Profile %}, {% cite clio_2020 %}, {% cite AttorneyAtWork_2019 %}. As of 2010, only 11.4% of all American lawyers were men and women of color, and this only rose to 14.1% in 2020 {%cite ABA2020Profile %}, {% cite clio_2020 %}, {% cite AttorneyAtWork_2019 %}. In developed countries, like America, it is said that minorities remain underrepresented in the legal profession; however, there is limited information on the legal environment of the Caribbean-an environment where the majority of the population would historically be non-white. As of the 2010 Saint Lucian census, the "ethnic group" of "African Descents" represented about 85.28 percent of the population (the highest); this was distantly followed by the "Mixed" category with 10.85 percent, and the "East Indian" at 2.16 percent {% cite CSO_SLU2010 %}.

Additionally, household settings and upbringing may shape or influence individual interests. Multiculturalism is quite prevalent in the Caribbean, and that upbringing might impact multilingual abilities. While formal education may be a primary factor in language acquisition, various states of immigration over generations, or other forms of diversity in their household, might influence their linguistic capacities. Identifying participant ethnicity/race is another standard demographic inquiry; nevertheless, it explores whether or not there are any differences in linguistics interests among the lawyers based on their backgrounds. 


2.  Please indicate the number of years you have been in practice (number of years since your first call to the bar in the Common-Wealth etc.)

Less than 1

An additional means of narrowing down the underlying multilinguistic tendencies in this field involves inquiring into the specialization areas of lawyers. This focus will highlight which practices may be associated with a need to speak multiple languages; more specifically, which law topics are likely to require an understanding of Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language. St. Lucia is a sovereign island nation in the Commonwealth of Nations but, because Saint Lucia was both a French and English colony before it gained independence on the 22nd of February, 1979, the legal system has been a mix of civil and English common law {% cite specialitysmith_2020 %}.

There could be an argument for the economic reinforcement of certain linguistic standards based on what a lawyer earns. It may be interesting to note if a multilingual can request and acquire more money due to their linguistic abilities. The Average Attorney Salary of a lawyer located in the sister island country of Dominica is around 2,950 XCD per month {% cite DOMsalary %}. Salaries there range from 1,360 XCD (lowest) to 4,680 XCD (highest). Yet, according to salaryexplorer.com, a Saint Lucian  Attorney typically earns around 5,500 XCD per month;  this is with salaries ranging from 2,530 XCD (lowest) to 8,750 XCD (highest). The minimum wage rate in Saint Lucia last changed at the beginning of 2013, yet it currently stands at XCD 300 a month for office clerks, XCD 200 for shop assistants, and XCD 160 for messengers, according to minimum-wage.org {% cite SLU2020wages %}.

This question concerning student debt is typical of the ABA but adjusted for a Saint Lucian setting. Results may indicate if this career path is indeed lucrative for the students. Thus results can somewhat gauge the stability of the industry.


7.  Please indicate if your workplace directly offers any formal foreign language assistance programs to clients.

Yes, an internal service is available to clients.

No, an external service would be recommended (for example, a court-appointed interpreter).

Prefer not to respond.

This question would confirm the presence of legal aid in Saint Lucia. It would simultaneously note general lawyer awareness of the availability of such services.


8.  Please indicate if a perceived language barrier has ever limited any of your attorney-client interactions; please select all that apply.

No

Yes, they used a form of sign language.

Yes, they used English.

Yes, they used Saint Lucian Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/Patios).

Yes, they used Russian (or any European language not mentioned)

Yes, they used Japanese.

Yes, they used Mandarin.

Yes, they used language not listed above.

Prefer not to respond

This question seeks to explore the personal linguistic limitations of lawyers in a multilingual environment. It may reinforce the perceived need for lawyers to acquire additional languages. 


9.  If you do speak more than one language, please indicate if your multilingual skill was ever a crucial asset to representing a client.

I do not speak more than one language

Yes

No

Prefer not to respond

This question seeks to understand the current and demand for multilingualism in lawyering, based on past demand. These details may reveal sufficiencies as well as insufficiencies concerning the adequate legal representation of  Saint Lucian clients. Saint Lucia is a multilingual country, and a lawyer with multiple languages may stand a better chance of not only attracting a diverse and numerous clientele base; reduced language barriers would allow lawyers to better relay facts, arguments, and sentiments of clients with diverse backgrounds.


10. Please indicate the language you use most often to communicate and your proficiency.


    1. Note: Selecting only "listen (understand)" encompasses scenarios where one can comprehend but not converse in a language.

    2.  Please indicate which technique best describes how you came to learn the aforementioned language; please select all that apply. 

Column categories:
Formal education (requirement/ elective); Informal education
(hobby); Informal education (from family & friends); Not applicable

Row categories: First Language.

The first half of this question is one of the most crucial to this study. Saint Lucia is an actively changing multilingual environment. The setting is dynamically developing due to evolving political and legal policies (such as Citizenship by Investment (CIP) {% cite bayat_2020 gis_CIP_2017 slu_cip_2020 capital_CIP_2020 harvey_2020 investvisa_2016 %}. English is listed as it is the official language spoken (a prestige language) in Saint Lucia. Apart from modern English, legal (and medical) professionals can claim to be multilingual based on their foundational Latin studies; noting this detail acknowledges this inherent field facet. Saint Lucian Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/Patios) is inquired about, as it is the heritage language of the island. French and Spanish are listed as they are typical language offerings at all high schools on the island. Dutch, and Portuguese, and to a lesser extent Arabic, Hindi, and Gaelige/Irish are other common languages to the rest of the Caribbean due to colonialization, indentured labor, and the ease of immigration among Caribbean islands. Japanese has been taught in Saint Lucia by humanitarian volunteers as part of their Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) work {% cite kobayashi_2020 %}. There also appears to be a rapidly growing Mandarin-speaking population in the Caribbean. It is important to ensure that the legal system can support the increasing numbers of Mandarin-speaking immigrants of various backgrounds (including investors, tourists, CIP purchasers, and foreign officials (for various joint government projects).

The column category "understand" was added to account for the possible occurrence of receptive bilingualism among lawyers in the Caribbean. This consideration is valid as multilingualism is prevalent in this region. Persons here may encounter various languages yet be unable to respond effectively. The presence of a "prestige" language, such as English, may draw speakers away from heritage languages. These heritage languages can suffer from dropping numbers of speakers when receptive bilingualism is left undeveloped.

The second half of this question is related to exploring where and how one engages in language learning and might highlight environments that foster multilingualism in lawyers. The learning of languages may take place in formal and informal settings. In Saint Lucia, most language education is likely to be done in a school setting. Overall, Saint Lucian Kwéyòl, a national heritage language, would typically be learned informally. Formal education of this language only recently began with young children (between the ages of 6-12) in less than a handful of schools and adult learners; however, since the major fire at the National Folk Resource Center, most classes have reverted to more private sessions. Renewed attention to the national language policy has redirected efforts to formal education of the language. However, enforcement of this policy appears to be challenging.

11. Please rank any secondary languages you use most often to communicate and your proficiency. 

    1.  Note: Selecting only "listen (understand)" encompasses scenarios where one can comprehend but not converse in a language.

Row categories: Second Language (2nd most often used at home & elsewhere); Third Language (3rd most often used at home & elsewhere)

Column categories: Language; Speak/Sign; Read; Write; Listen/Understand

    2.  Please indicate which technique best describes how you came to learn each of the aforementioned languages; please select all that apply.

Column categories:
Formal education (requirement/ elective); Informal education
(hobby); Informal education (from family & friends); Not applicable

Row categories: Second Language, Third Language

The first and second parts of this question are related to the previous question on language acquisition environments. However, these questions delve deeper into the presence of multilinguals in this profession, rather than the prior question's focus on identifying the details of one's primary language. The parameters of the prior question are used here, yet answering is optional.

12.  Please indicate which language frequency category best reflects your typical client interactions. This question only requires one response per row.

Column categories: Very Frequently; Frequently; Occasionally; Rarely; Very Rarely; Never.

Row categories:
Any form of sign language
English
Saint Lucian Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/Patios)
Haitian Creole

Since this survey cannot acquire data from past clients, this question aims to address the languages that lawyers commonly encounter. The language one speaks is not guaranteed to be what one will encounter. It will be interesting to note where the client and lawyer languages overlap and where they do not. Answering is not optional here as this information is crucial to the survey.
