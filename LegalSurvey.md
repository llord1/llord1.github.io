### Introduction:

Effective communication can mean the difference between life and death in fields of practice such as medicine and law. These include police forces, judges, and lawyers, among others. Several careers in society can contribute to the general sense of safety and security that Maslow has referred to in his well-known hierarchy of needs. Therefore, thoughtful data collection and monitoring of these critical services can enhance and optimize their performance. 

### Literature Review:

Lack of labor demographic and linguistic data in Saint Lucia:

Thoughtful deliberation of linguistics, particularly consideration of language barriers, is increasing in the medical field. As recently as 2019, Sweden conducted a national study on health care professionals' communications through interpreters; this study occurred after noting that many parents utilizing neonatal care were foreign-born and unable to effectively communicate with the healthcare professionals in the local language {% cite patriksson2019health %}. In 2013, an investigation highlighted communications issues between physicians and Spanish-speaking Latin American women with pelvic floor disorders {% cite sevilla2013communication %}. That study highlighted that apart from a patient's lack of disease understanding, there was a lack of Spanish proficiency among the participating physicians. Another 2013 qualitative study (conducted on linguistics) centered around the perceptions of patient-provider communication in breast and cervical cancer-related care when dealing with low-income English and Spanish-speaking women {% cite simon2013perceptions %}. In 2009, there was similar work done on a competent peer support intervention for Spanish-speaking Latinas with breast cancer {% cite napoles2009developing %}. 

Questioning the possible ties of linguistics to various professions is not necessarily new, yet few resources have been dedicated to detecting communication issues and improving communication within multilingual countries. An interesting pivot would be the investigation of multilingual professionals and noting if they have sufficient access to language resources, should their primary language not be the dominant language of the country in which they practice. One study did investigate Spanish–English bilingual psychotherapists and their personal and professional language development and use {% cite verdinelli2009spanish %}. Another study observed instances where nurses double as interpreters (a study of Spanish-speaking patients in an American primary care setting) {% cite elderkin2001nurses %}.

While data collection of various professions can be conducted by private companies, it is typically completed by government labor agencies. This undertaking ensures that the results on labor force statistics are freely available to the public. In America, the Bureau of Labor Statistics collects such data and hosts it on a public website {% cite BLS2020 %}. While not all developing nations have been able to dedicate resources to the close monitoring of this data, its value is increasingly recognized.

While the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics provides general information on the demographics of the lawyers in the country, the American Bar Association (ABA) gathers more detailed information on Legal Profession Statistics {% cite aba_2020 BLS2020 %}. Their current statistical data assisted with research on lawyers and the legal profession. Their website notes data on lawyer demographics (including disability, women, and minority/people of color topics). It also encompasses justice system statistics (including public perception of justice system/lawyers and the justice system matters), court statistics (including cases filed and criminal justice statistics). This association also notes the topics of law students and education and legal salaries (and related attrition/retention data).

Currently, the collection of lawyer demographics in Saint Lucia (SLU) are not centralized. The 2016 Labour Force Survey, made publicly available by The Central Statistical Office of SLU, did inquire into a participant's industry - "What is the name of the business where you/....... work? What type of activity is carried on there?" {% cite  govtSLU_Labour_2017 %}. However, the dataset ultimately appears to have been simplified to the point where details on individual professions were rendered indiscernible. The closest response, related to lawyers, would be one that highlighted "professional, scientific and technical activities"; this made up 1.0%  (51 participants) of the survey. A representative of The Central Statistical Office of SLU stated that the data of the 2016 Labour Force Survey was "not disaggregated in such a way to get a count of all lawyers" {% cite govtSLU_Labour_2017 %}. The survey also stated that since the 2016 Labour Force Survey "utilizes a sample if it were to give a figure it would not be representative" {% cite govtSLU_Labour_2017 %}. Ultimately, even the president of the Bar Association of SLU, also confirmed that she was unaware of the departments of government bearing statistical data specific to lawyers.

Saint Lucia's National Environmental Information System (NEIS)  has been one of the latest governmental attempts at collecting and organizing national data {% cite govtSLU_NEIS_2019 %}, {% cite govtSLU_NEIS %}, {% cite govtSLUdata %}. The "Project Reporting System for Multilateral Environmental Agreement (MEA) Implementation and Environmental Information Management" has been regarded as a "legal instrument with binding effects on countries that have agreed to become parties" {% cite govtSLU_NEIS %}. Saint Lucia's participation in this international agreement enhances global agreements and sustainable development projects moving forward. However, one current category that highlights the "employed labor force by industry", is classified as having a low priority level.

A need for additional data regarding lawyer demographics in Saint Lucia has been identified. To address this need, while following social distancing protocols, online surveying was selected as the tool of data collection. Ultimately, such a survey can be applied to lawyers, teachers, nurses, or police officers - any profession that requires direct extended interaction with a citizen to provide a sense of safety and security.

The Saint Lucian digital environment and survey instruments:

Data collection via surveys is virtually challenging to conduct anywhere. However, in developing nations, limited access to various forms of infrastructure provides additional obstructions. One paper cited at least three major challenges to conducting surveys in the Caribbean {% cite tindigarukayo2001challenges %}. Firstly, it stated there were issues with meager sampling frames from which to select representative samples (especially when sampling noninstitutionalized populations). Secondly, administering various survey instruments was difficult; mailers were challenging due to unreliable postal systems, telephone interviews would be inherently biased due to limited access to telecommunication infrastructure and devices, and local pockets of crime made in-person interviews problematic. Thirdly, effectively surveying these areas of much inherent cultural and linguistic diversity would be challenging.

However, difficulties in surveying the population may vary based on occupation, education level, and income level. Due to the nature of their jobs, lawyers are likely to have access to modern communication technologies. While many tasks may involve interacting with archives and records that may not be fully digitized, timely communication is crucial to their work. The recent implementation and utilization of the e-litigation system demonstrate their access and willingness to adapt to new forms of technology. Via online platforms and databases, lawyers can complete online filing of cases and document uploads from any internet-accessible device; the value of this system was highlighted during the pandemic. 

Membership in the Saint Lucia Bar Association provides a central point of communication and information distribution to potential participants. Moreover, the current president of the association, Renee St. Rose, is said to have set a "transformative agenda"; one that welcomes the growth of the country's justice system, and the utilization of various available tools, including technology, to facilitate her goals {% cite morris_2019 %}.

Overall, this work aims to gather general demographic data of lawyers and identify patterns of multilingual legal representation on the multilingual island of Saint Lucia. There will be a specific focus on the second most prevalent language - “Saint Lucian Kwéyòl”. Participant responses will be processed using textual analytical tools to provide insight into the legal environment that Saint Lucians, particularly Kwéyòl speakers, experience.


### Methodology: 

The Legal profession currently heavily uses internet-accessible communication devices provides an apt setting for digital surveys. Jotform.com hosts the online survey as other generic online forms, such as Google Forms or Surveymonkey, had fewer customization offerings. The president of the Saint Lucia Bar Association will facilitate its distribution within the organization. Advertisements with local news and radio stations will not be necessary for promotion.
