The increasing popularity of opinion rich resources such as blogs {% cite kweyol_works_joseph %}, shopping websites, review portals, and social media platforms {% cite kweyol_fb_joseph %} are rapidly attracting business people, governments, and researchers alike. While there are multiple ways to utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) functions, sentiment analysis often garners high interest to businesses. However, in the realm of cross-lingual, or multilingual NLP, it does appear that some languages tend to get more attention. Typically well-established languages with a plethora of linguistic resources to build from, often thrive, while low-resource creole languages are left to languish. Creoles are a particular challenge of the NLP community as they often arise from the urgent need to establish harmony in communication within cacophonous settings. Creole languages emerge as a result of resilience; a struggle to work within the bounds of a dominant prestige primary language while retaining culturally unique languages or dialects. However, it is the very discordant origin, and complexity of structure within, that poses issues for the study and preservation of creole languages. For example, while just over 83% of Saint Lucian Kwéyòl/creole has French origins, the author of the official creole dictionary acknowledged gaps in vocabulary related to the official etymological details of over 11% of its words. Not much NLP research has been done on adapting its components to creole languages, therefore, the careful creation of tools and frameworks is needed to facilitate all of society's language needs.

Word sense disambiguation and issues with dependency parsers highlight very difficult tasks in natural language processing; a major challenge of lexical semantics is creating training data and algorithms that facilitate downstream tasks. Moreover, it has also been said while there is a lingering 'bias towards contemporary Indo-European languages', treebanks for other language families and treebanks for classical languages are on the rise {% cite nivre2016universal %}. It has been suggested that categorizing the challenges and formalizing their interpretation using Universal Dependencies may aid in creating a Saint Lucian Kwéyòl dependency treebank, and later facilitate other needed NLP tasks. A Saint Lucian Kwéyòl parser may be built by leveraging the base knowledge of French syntax. However, these may not be the only tools required to tackle the issues of digitizing and analyzing creole languages. Therefore, it may be helpful to develop a framework to improve the models for linguistics. Perhaps an extendable framework that can demonstrate its application to low-resource languages such as creole.
