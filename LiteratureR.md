## Introduction to the Data Science Biocultural Diversity (DSBD) Framework

## Background: Societal issues highlighted by a pandemic.

In 2019 a novel coronavirus was recorded; by its official 2020 designation as a pandemic, the modern world had to grapple with, and react to, its many shortcomings {% cite who_2020 allam2020first %}. This situation sparked numerous investigative reports into societal inequities that threatened to inundate many healthcare and economic systems. Moreover, it highlighted extreme cases of bureaucracy, corruption, discrimination, and even racism {% cite feffer_2020 terziev2020increasing lancet2020covid ortega2020governing haug2020ranking weine2020justice waymer2020addressing corburn2020slum gravlee2020systemic mendes2020can dave2020black %}. Systemic failings were noted as having powerful direct and indirect impacts on the planet and its inhabitants.

Notably, as modern commerce ground to a halt, the environment appeared to thrive. Many early reports noted that air quality had drastically improved in some areas {% cite newsroom_2020 bauwens__et al._2020 he2020short arb_2020 mahato2020effect %}. Wildlife began to flourish in some areas, and these animals were even spotted venturing out into once-bustling commercial sectors {% cite christiancovid weston_readers_2020 garlick_2020 winter_2020 %}. In some areas, there were even notable reductions in accidental animal killings along typically high traffic routes {% cite katz_2020 %}. 

However, the progress made during this period was highlighted as being very fragile; and that the period of lockdown has not benefited all forms of life {% cite garlick_2020 fine_maron_2020 davies_2020  locatelli_2020 %}. In extreme cases, the funding of research and preservation of species {% cite simon_2020 %}, of poacher policing {% cite fine_maron_2020 locatelli_2020 %}, and of care for captive animals (particularly those areas reliant on public gatherings of locals and tourists), experienced reductions {% cite garlick_2020 fine_maron_2020 davies_2020 locatelli_2020 %}. Moreover, early air quality improvements have been diminished by continuous wildfires worldwide {% cite carlsen_mcminn_eng_2020 houghton_2020 neill_2020 hamedy_2020 arb_2020 %}. Notably, the strength and duration of these, formally natural, fires are increasingly exacerbated by human action; this ranges from deliberate destruction {% cite sullivan_2019 pedroso_reverdosa_2020 garcia_2019 spring_marcello_2020 %}, to careless destruction {% cite jack_2020 shepherd_2020 %}, but also includes that which is facilitated by inadequate climate policies {% cite tollefson_2020 harvey_2020 worland_2020 gupta_regan_kottasová_2020 %}. The tenuous nature of these environmental improvements signaled the power of individual actions.


## Surviving

This time of isolation did facilitate a much needed period of reflection in society {% cite he2020impact %}. Some families found that isolation improved their relationships, while others found the opposite to be true (as cases domestic abuse increased) {% cite mazza2020danger campbell2020increasing bradbury2020pandemic jones2020pandemic bullinger2020covid  mamun2020mother %}. Modern technology was found to bridge the physical gap of in-person communications. However, while some people struggled to competently utilize the gamut of modernized communication tools, others struggled to merely gain access to these resources {% cite garbe2020parents van2020covid collis_vegas_2020 adnan2020online %}.

During this difficult time, individuals became keenly aware of their mortality and their perceived needs. To better cope with such a precarious environment, some sought structure and meaning through the review of and reflection on various texts; well-known psychological theories concerning the prioritization of needs include Maslow's hierarchy  {% cite matias2020human casale2020interpersonally wong2020healing %}. Some people actively sought, yet struggled to address their basic physiological needs {% cite corburn2020slum van2020covid steavenson_2020 pulighe2020food power2020covid %}, while also attempting to address their needs for safety {% cite mukherjee2020perfect mazza2020danger campbell2020increasing bradbury2020pandemic jones2020pandemic %}, love and belonging {% cite berg2020loneliness campbell2020increasing %}, esteem {% cite bhasker2020patients wong2020healing  %}, and even self-actualization {% cite casale2020interpersonally wong2020healing salari2020prevalence %}.

Ultimately, this reflection period facilitated the review and reprioritization of needs and the rethinking of modern institutions. Citizens, and consumers alike, became aware of inconsistencies in the prioritization of certain resources and industries by businesses and governments. Recent investigations revealed that some leaders prioritized the stock market numbers over Covid-19 death numbers {% cite menton_2020 %}; prioritized environmental rollbacks over increasing its protection, prioritized funding for warfare over supplies of personal protective equipment for citizens; and some fights abroad for human rights over its domestic application. 

Such reflection aided in more purposeful consumer patronage, and increased openness to expressing various values and beliefs {% cite he2020impact %}. Many persons were also roused to solicit improved equality in justice systems, fair and free elections, improved environmental standards, and expanded access to resources associated with their basic needs. The complications of modern societies had been building up over time, worldwide; yet, in a time where access to vital resources became restricted, many individuals were driven to reflect on, and actively address,  the adequacy of their societal-systems to provide for their perceived needs.


## Background: The role of data science, digital humanities, and biocultural diversity

Years of study may be required to become fully aware of the actual societal and environmental toll of the most recent pandemic in modern history. Globally, there is a base understanding of the utter urgency with which all nations are attempting to cope with the many disruptions caused by the pandemic. Academics, and citizen scientists alike, openly shared data and contributed findings as quickly as possible {% cite kupferschmidt_2020 gewin_2020%}. Even data science enthusiasts were able to make remarkable contributions to global efforts. Avi Schiffmann, a US high schooler, gained worldwide fame for this ability to employ his web-scraping skills to create the first online visual case tracker dashboard {% cite crane_2020  meisenzahl_2020  schiffmann2020 %}; it was free and globally accessible. Albeit a fledgling data scientist, Schiffmann's creation, through the combination of his interests and skills, was eventually monitored and followed by various institutions and individuals worldwide, while authorities were scrambling to allocate the necessary resources to accomplish this task {% cite samarrai_2020 %}.

Global citizens began assessing current problematic policies and strove to create and cement positive policies for the future. Institutions began revisiting past policy proposals that overlooked, as these may prove to provide positive impacts on the general public. Notably, academics renewed efforts to investigate biodiversity conservation. On a small-scale, some institutions sought and secured approvals for extending nature reserves. On a larger-scale, despite some regulatory rollbacks, as of July 7th, climate activists saw celebrated the abandonment of the Atlantic Coast Pipeline, and the shut-down and emptying of the Dakota Access Pipeline, pending a long-awaited thorough environmental review.
Therefore, a genuine value can be generated from studies in the areas of Digital Humanities (DH) and Biocultural Diversity (BCD), as they specifically focus on the intrinsic connection between societal structures and its possible harmony with their surroundings.

Digital Humanities can be interpreted as the intersection of computing (or digital technologies and humanities disciplines. It can be the strategic and systematic implementation and utilization of digital resources on the study of the humanities and further analysis of their application. For example, this can take the form of creating digital art using Neural Style Transfer techniques and Tensorflow tools, creating new literature from recurrent neural networks, as well as deciphering ancient text from images and scans of relics. 

Luisa Maffi was the co-founder and director of Terralingua and a pioneer in the Biocultural Diversity domain of research. She revealed the interrelated (and possibly coevolved) nature of the diversity of all forms of life within a complex socio-ecological adaptive system. According to Maffi, biological, cultural, and scientific complexity add to the various forms of diversity in life. Moreover, BCD proved to have gained momentum; literature was composed to support its inclusion in the "conceptual repertoire" of researchers and policy-makers.

Motivation is essential to change, however, to properly allocate resources, data collection and analysis should occur. Data science offers a plethora of tools in which to explore our world. However, it is often a difficult task to decipher what tools to use and when. Developing the skill and capacity to achieve this requires quite a bit of study. It also requires a significant degree of concern and compassion to dedicate resources into research that may not have a direct, immediate, or substantial financial reward. 

## The Goal:

This framework aims to provide strategic guidance through core data science concepts and skills and apply them to Digital Humanities and Biocultural Diversity matters. The interdisciplinary application of Maslow's hierarchy of needs will facilitate a user's exploration of data science and humanitarian works. This framework should be an introductory learning aid, and therefore can be utilized in formal and informal educational settings.

The employment of the framework is scalable for both micro and macro-scale projects. It would be capable of evaluating an individual's career path, and also assess entire countries and regions; this would be an assessment of an entity's biocultural diversity rating (matters of environmental and cultural awareness). This framework also explores the practical, low-cost application of data science topics that may aid in humanitarian efforts. Ultimately, the structure would be simplified enough to inspire users of varying skill levels to make valuable contributions to society. 


## The Foundational Framework

In line with the pursuit of societal and environmental reform, a simple humanitarian framework was considered as a base structure to direct a researcher to relevant concepts and tools. In 1943 an article entitled "A Theory of Human Motivation" was published to the *Psychological Review*. The author, Abraham Maslow, put forth a psychological theory that would evolve into a recognizable visual business tool. The model was a five-tiered hierarchy of human needs as a motivational theory in psychology. Maslow recommended that the base tier be satisfied before individuals attend to those above. He later clarified that one's absolute satisfaction of a need would not limit movement between layers, as personal prioritization can vary). One should think of these as continuously overlapping levels as not everyone will move through the hierarchy in a uni-directional manner.

The five-tiered hierarchy of human needs are physiological, safety, love and belonging, esteem, and self-actualization. The bottom-tier deals with physiological needs related to biological requirements for human survival, like air, food, drink, shelter, clothing, warmth, sex, sleep. Safety needs are related to security (including emotional security and financial security) and safety (including law and order, freedom from fear, social stability, property, health, and well-being). Love and belongingness needs pertain to affiliating (being part of a group), friendship, intimacy, trust, acceptance, and receiving and giving affection and love. Esteem needs encompass concepts of esteem for oneself (dignity, achievement, mastery, independence) and the desire for reputation or respect from others (notably status and prestige). The top-tier deals with self-actualization needs are related to the realization of a person's potential, self-fulfillment, seeking personal growth and peak experiences.

There are versions of this framework bearing up to eight-tiers. In this version, esteem needs are expanded and segmented out to form a  cognitive needs level (ranked above it). Cognitive needs are related to knowledge and understanding, curiosity, exploration, need for meaning, and predictability. The Aesthetic needs reside above this. These needs are an appreciation and search for beauty, balance, and form, and among other matters. Finally, Transcendence needs, usurp Self-actualization needs' top-tier position. Transcendence needs relate to a person motivated by values that transcend beyond the personal self; these may relate to service to others, the pursuit of science, and religious faith, among other matters.

During the pandemic, many work dynamics have changed, and some employers look to this framework to better understand and motivate their employees. Companies had to contend with higher than usual numbers of remote employees. Others had to facilitate remote-working for the first time. Functional facilities, capable of retaining employees, had to contend with increased safety and cleaning practices. The rigor of new operational standards would result in workflow issues, decreased productivity, and motivation.

Malow's framework is not new, yet it continues to be employed to explain human motivation across different fields at micro and macro-levels. Researchers recently used this framework to understand adolescent depressive symptoms over time and to identify the factors contributing to student nurse success. Maslow's theory was also employed in economic development and national intelligence discussions. Notably, it also had educational applications. Maslow is said to have adopted a holistic approach to education and learning; that students' basic physiological needs, of food and rest, should be addressed before their cognitive needs.

Some persons familiar with project management might be able to envision a connection between Maslow's hierarchy of needs and the field of technology. For example, some would liken the rigidity of the Waterfall approach (a strictly linear development process) to the rigidity of the Maslow's initial attempts at interpreting the incremental steps of his model.

Notably, Maslow's hierarchy has also been informally applied to the field of data science. While unable to find many scholarly publications on the matter, a few data science enthusiasts have attempted to explore a hierarchy of data science needs; a visual interpretation of the skills associated with this fairly new field. In 2017, Monica Rogati was credited with the creation of a similar pyramid structure that focuses on what skills impact the careers of individual data scientists; at the base would be data collection, and then movement and storage, exploration and transformation, aggregation and labeling, and ended with learning and optimization (related to artificial intelligence, deep learning and well as experimentation and simple machine learning algorithms among other details).  In 2018, Hugh Williams revisited this framework and began to consider the unique data science needs of individual companies; he incorporated the need to consider the needs of specialist companies and well as generalist companies.

## The Flaws:

Despite its ubiquity of application, Maslow's framework is not without critique. While it has been repeatedly proven to evoke innate recognition of human nature in oneself and others, some contest the methodology for his studies. Some stated that some of his terms were too ambiguous; some argued that non-human needs should also be considered, and that "self-actualization" far too open to interpretation. Maslow was also said to have been very selective with the individuals chosen for his research; he selected pursued highly productive and accomplished individuals, his rankings were problematic when attempting to address gender and societal differences.

Notably, Maslow's hierarchy of needs is often employed to illustrate why projects have failed (particularly the five-tiered version). Due to being sought as issues arise, this theory begets a negative connotation. However, a lesser-known, more introspective eight-tiered version does exist.

## The Proposed Framework:

With the reenvisioning of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the public might have a more positive perspective of this pyramid. Those wishing to enact change in their spaces can be reassured that each completed project is a step closer to a better understanding of what is happening and what can then be done. 

Moreover, this novel structure can serve as a self-assessment tool. One may use it when reviewing past tasks and or when revaluating career choices. It can serve as a means of ascertaining if one's choices have effectively contributed to any of their needs and if it promoted personal progress. It may also offer direction to those considering a career in data science yet lack sufficient exposure to practical applications of concepts. 

This framework may very well be useful in both formal and informal educational settings. The broad field of Data Science can benefit from its implementation, as well as the areas of Digital Humanities and Biocultural Diversity. It may be considered as part of one's introductory course material in all the aforementioned areas, as this may better direct them to areas of interest for further research. Additionally, it may be used as revision materials for graduating students, as a means of ensuring they achieved a well-rounded education. Such an introspective, yet comprehensive framework could then be viewed as a truly motivational, inspirational, and aspirational. 

The positive structure of the framework would allow users to better grasp the practical application of data science concepts; they would, therefore, generate more quantifiably valid datasets, models, and concepts. The projects being attempted would not eradicate the necessity for professionally-trained data scientists; nor lessen the importance and sophistication of the field. It stands to foster a sense of interest in data science through accessibility while also promoting greater societal and environmental awareness. The collection of various forms of data is increasingly commonplace. Individuals and small groups utilizing this framework are poised to be reasonably capable of assessing situations that require rapid change, based on their increased access to technology and a heightened awareness of societal and environmental issues. 

Moreover, it is crucial to note that the *Agile Manifesto* expressly presented guidance rather than a prescriptive methodology, and Scrum is a management framework with self-organizing teams working towards incremental product development. While project management frameworks (even those specifically catered to wildlife-conservation) do exist, the overlapping layers and versatility of Maslow's hierarchy may appeal to resource-strapped independent researchers or modestly financed teams. Bearing this in mind, project management frameworks can be employed when pursuing each personal project. This framework aims to aid in providing project inspiration and goal acquisition through a guided structure. 

Avi Schiffmann stands a perfect example of how one person, though not a degree holder, was able to make a swift global impact using very little resources. One could observe that, according to Maslow's hierarchy, his basic needs were being met; thusly, he was able to devote time and effort into matters that interested him. However, it is also important to note that his passion for data science and its application allowed him to hone in on an emerging global issue. He was able to utilize the cobbled together skills and effectively applied them to inform a global audience. Out of concern for the overtly bleak outlook of his website, he added a quick facts feature to note recovery numbers; he wished to provide hope to users by making positive statistics more easily accessible. Moreover, in an entirely altruistic act, he turned down the opportunity to receive  $8 million for advertisements on his case-tracking website. He did not want to profit the deaths and illnesses of others and instead refocused to create a new website concerning advocacy for the Black-Lives-Matter-Protests. 

In the end, one could also say that Schiffmann managed to fully work his way through Maslow's hierarchy to the levels of Self-actualization and Transcendence. Being so young, he may be afforded the time to reevaluate his needs and set new personal goals within Maslow's model. And, perhaps, he may be able to use this proposed framework as a structure of guidance towards his next impactful project.

As an aspiring data scientist, I hope to contribute as much as possible to the field, and society at large, especially in the form of education. To address my relationship with Maslow's hierarchy of needs, I have proposed a framework that will be called the "Data Science Biocultural Diversity (DSBD) Framework. It will explore the topics of Maslow's hierarchy's tiers within the context of biocultural diversity and digital humanities, while also exploring various data science concepts and tools. 
While the five-tier model is an established entity, the eight-tier version of this model may be more applicable.

## The Framework's Levels:

- __*Biological and physiological needs*__  can be explored as topics related to __*Ambience*__.

Maslow suggests that one's innate biological and physiological needs, such as air, food, drink, shelter, warmth, and sleep, and sex, therefore, the base level of the proposed framework would serve to explore datasets and topics related to these matters. 

At the first level of the pyramid, one may begin by using simple public datasets and simple exploratory techniques and technology. However, the process of sourcing proper data for experimentation can be complicated. While the utilization of primary and secondary data sourcing is encouraged, it is crucial to note that some works require permissions from specific parties, such as an Institutional Review Board (IRB), before the data can even be collected. Researchers seeking official academic publications of their works need to meet a high level of rigor.

A critical look into one's data can also assist with calculated self-improvement, and thus better address the needs of the first level of Maslow's biological and physiological needs. Quite a few modern technologies allow users to collect their personal data. Initial experiments on some personal data can assist in honing one's skills. For example, one can explore personal Fitbit data to determine metrics on one's restful and actives states. Python can be used to create an interactive dashboard to view details. Furthermore, one can utilize personal finance data to explore this topic. 

The attainment of shelter and warmth is also vital to Maslow's needs. Therefore, one can explore data concerning the housing market; this can include rental rates, ownership rates, and overall availability. The clothing and fashion industry data are other areas that one can investigate at this level.

Persons do, however, exist in an environment. Increasing environmental awareness and wildlife awareness are essential components to the conservation works that the biocultural diversity lens would promote. One can utilize public meteorological and air quality datasets. The investigation of matters related to flora and fauna is encouraged at this level. 

As the lowest level topic, the application of simple exploratory data analysis with tools like Python and R  Studio is acceptable for simple projects. However, one may also undertake more elaborate methods of investigation at this level. For example, one can use computer vision to aid in the identification of varying stages of ripeness or disease of endemic (or vital) crops. People are also able to employ computer vision to track fauna. However, spectrographic analysis utilizing Raven Pro software from the Cornell Lab may assist in the bioacoustic study of vulnerable species, and note levels noise pollution. 

- __*Safety and security needs*__ can be explored as topics related to __*Assets*__.

The pursuit of this level would allow for the exploration of safety needs related to security (including emotional security and financial security) and safety (including law and order, freedom from fear, social stability, property, health, and well-being). One can perform data analysis on economic or demographic data, including census data, or other public access government statistics.  For example, one can provide an investigation into local education, crime, and gun ownership statistics as all these matters can impact one's sense of security.

Exploration of topics related to safety needs can also encompass the analysis of the economic impact of specific industries such as tourism, and its numerous types. For example, one can quantifiably assess the different attractions of an area to determine its main tourism driver. In terms of security, one could also explore the link between crimes and certain influencing factors. Once again, this lower level topic can allow for the application of simple exploratory data analysis with tools like Python and R  Studio;  yet, more elaborate analysis is achievable. 

- __*Love and belonging needs*__ can be explored as topics related to __*Affiliation*__.

Maslow's love and belonging needs can highlight how interpersonal relationships motivate behavior. Such relationships encompass those based on friendship, intimacy, trust, and acceptance, receiving and giving affection and love. One can harbor the desire to be included in a group, and therefore generate an affiliation with family members, friends, and workmates.

Some may take this opportunity to explore societal affiliation in terms of sports team data, racial segregation, or perhaps study the dynamics of group cohesion. However, this level also provides an opportunity to explore affiliation facilitated by communication. The pursuit of this level would allow research into data linguistics. 

One may be able to delve into language affiliation and ethnolinguistic identity. For example, in a multilingual society of Kwéyòl, French, Spanish, and English, one can study a native language and observe the impact of the presence of others. One can also attempt to explore biocultural diversity through mapping areas of high fluency areas to identify language hotspots. Such an endeavor could be particularly useful for tracking endangered languages. 
 
Communication barriers can present issues with affiliation goals; therefore it may be useful to study how physical and mental limitations can impact affiliation. For example, even neurolinguistics topics related to traumatic brain injury and aphasia can be sorted into this level; this is because it can be useful to investigate topics that hamper effective communication and create tools to address these issues. 

In terms of technology, the same base of Python and R can be utilized; however, one can also attempt more intensive data linguistic tools and techniques. Tensorflow with the implementation of neural machine translation (with Attention mechanisms) along with co-occurrence graphs different subject matters.

- __*Self-esteem needs*__ can be explored as topics related to __*Attitudes*__.

Maslow's fourth level esteem needs were originally classified into two categories of esteem for oneself (dignity, achievement, mastery, independence), and the desire for reputation or respect from others (such as status and prestige). Maslow highlighted that these needs were crucial for children and adolescents and precedes real self-esteem or dignity. 

One could argue that the concepts of esteem and perceptions are often linked; it is how one perceives themselves, and how others perceive them may add or subtract from their status, prestige, or sense of dignity. Data science enables the exploration of perceptions through several tools and techniques; most notably, sentiment analysis. Therefore, the pursuit of sentiment analysis projects would occur at this level. To better understand the perceptions of individuals, tools such as LIWC may be applied. It might also provide insight into some communities or regions.

For example, LIWC sentiment analysis can be performed on the works of established figures in specific industries. The works of individuals such as Maslow, himself,  and Noam Chomsky, can be studied due to their significance to academia. Based on the way they express themselves in their writing, one can glean insight into their underlying personalities. Sentiment analysis can support the exploration of the perceptions of individual languages, cultures, economic statuses, and environments. For instance, to assess the internal and external perceptions of a chosen country, Tripadvisor and Twitter data can be examined.


- __*Cognitive needs*__ can be explored as topics related to __*Analysis*__.

The pursuit of this level would allow one to truly address the need for knowledge and understanding, curiosity, exploration, need for meaning, and predictability. This could be in the form of the collection and analysis of data collected from digital surveys on various humanitarian topics. 

Users may question established principles of any topic of their choosing. One can challenge established industry policies, methods, or techniques, can be explored here. For example, one could launch an exploratory investigation into a country's national language policy and attempt to assess the effectiveness of language learning tools that support this system. This may also allow for the questioning of concepts associated with skill acquisition.

- __*Aesthetic needs*__ can be explored as topics related to __*Artistry*__.

The pursuit of this level would allow for the creation of literature or digital art. Natural Language Processing, as it relates to an unsupervised learning transformer model (GPT-2), can be employed for a text generation project. These technologies may become important to generate literature for languages in various states of vitality. Neural Style Transfer techniques and Tensorflow tools (such as DeepDream) can also be used to create new digital art based on traditional art styles or patterns.

- __*Self-actualization needs*__ can be explored as topics related to __*Awareness*__. 

Self- actualization needs tend to focus on an individual seeking personal growth and peak experiences; this would be an attempt to realize their potential and self-fulfillment. With self- actualization, one strives to be the ideal version of themselves. It would be the ambition "to become everything one is capable of becoming" (Maslow, 1987, p. 64). One may attempt achieving peak economic, or academic, or athletic prowess. For others, it may be expressed creatively, in paintings, pictures, or inventions.

The pursuit of this level would allow for an exploration of an established concept in data science pedagogy with the hopes of producing new teaching tools or techniques. This may include gamification of a relevant concept or the creation and completion of an application. Tools such as Dart and Flutter can be utilized to create applications. This could also involve employing deep computer vision and other machine learning techniques to document restoration and cataloging activities.


- __*Transcendence needs*__ can be explored as topics related to __*Altruism*__.   

A person is motivated by values that transcend beyond the personal self (e.g., mystical experiences and certain experiences with nature, aesthetic experiences, sexual experiences, service to others, the pursuit of science, religious faith, etc.).

The pursuit of this level would focus on developing citizen science projects that would contribute to future sustainability. This section may be the most challenging as it would require the conception of outputs for a department or organization dedicated to altruism. This could also include the creation of frameworks that can have a substantial and lasting impact on a specific group. For example, the formulation of a public online language acquisition system may support with language revitalization of an endangered language. It is also possible to curate and publish datasets; this is helpful as the sharing of datasets provides others with more opportunities for practicing these skills, and for future research.


## The Outcome:
This structure serves as a foundation for forming ideas for positive change. With this proposed framework, the order in which one can pursue the topics is not as significant as increased satisfaction the user will receive with the incremental completion of each area of knowledge. However, users that do complete tasks, for every level of the structure, are poised to provide meaningful data science contributions to the field and society at large. Ultimately, the user stands to attain an authentic sense of self-actualization. 

 This framework will provide a review outline for countries' leaders seeking wholesome change and innovation. It will aid leaders in addressing the needs of their people, with the most effective tools and technology available. Governments can ensure that matters related to the environment, the arts, and public sentiment are not sidelined, with the combination of Maslow's hierarchy of needs and data science skills and technologies.  Such careful consideration of the public's needs will undoubtedly enhance efforts to improve a country's status (such as its happiness index).


## The Obstacles:

Data Science is an actively developing field; due to program lengths for P.h.D programs, it may be very difficult to create a timely yet thorough compilation on all available topics, techniques, and technologies. The intention is not to compile a comprehensive list of all possible avenues of data science. It is to encourage interest in the field and provide starting points for personal journeys into data science topics. 

This endeavor is quite a complicated undertaking to publish as a single contributor. Co-authorship on works may be sought to competently manage the workload of research, and the coding of these tools. Framework users will require less preparation as introductory research on these tools would already have been completed.


## The Tools:

The tools may focus on open source and low-cost resources such as R Studio, Python, Dart, Flutter, LIWC, Github, Microsoft Office 365 tools (like Forms and Power BI),  Tensorflow, and other available Google tools available ). 

- Google Colab can be described as a Python development environment that runs in the browser using Google Cloud; it is completely free of charge, and even offers access to their GPU is free of charge for some hours of usage every day. 

- Raven Pro, as explained by told by Cornell Lab, is a software program for the acquisition, visualization, measurement, and analysis of sounds. Raven Pro presents a powerful, user-friendly research and teaching tool for scientists working with acoustic signals. Raven Pro’s highly configurable views provide exceptional flexibility in data display.
