## Introduction to... Framework

### Background:


### Establishing a Framework: 

### The Proposed Framework:

#### The Framework's Levels:

### The Goal:

#### The Obstacles:

Data Science is an actively developing field; due to program lengths for P.h.D programs, it may be very difficult to create a timely yet thorough compilation on all available topics, techniques, and technologies. The intention is not to compile a comprehensive list of all possible avenues of data science. It is to encourage interest in the field and provide starting points for personal journeys into data science topics. 

This endeavor is quite a complicated undertaking to publish as a single contributor. Co-authorship on works may be sought to competently manage the workload of research, and the coding of these tools. Framework users will require less preparation as introductory research on these tools would already have been completed.


#### The Tools:

The tools may focus on open source and low-cost resources such as R Studio, Python, Dart, Flutter, fastText, LIWC, Github, Microsoft Office 365 tools (like Forms and Power BI), Tensorflow, and other available Google tools available. 

- Google Colab can be described as a Python development environment that runs in the browser using Google Cloud; it is completely free of charge, and even offers access to their GPU is free of charge for some hours of usage every day.
