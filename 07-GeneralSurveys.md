### Introduction to Surveys

In 1999, the noted Caribbean scholar, Lawrence Carrington, declared "there has been no recent survey of the use of Creole languages in the Caribbean region and such a survey is absolutely required" {% cite Carrington1999 %}. Despite such a direct and dire proclamation, as of 2021, the need for quantifiable data and analysis of these environments and languages remains. Due to the increasing diversity of inhabitants in these spaces, effective communication may soon require the public's active use of multilingual skills. Yet, there are no definitive facts available on the current status of linguistic diversity in countries like Saint Lucia, nor is there data on the vitality of its remaining heritage language, as little recent research has been conducted.

Notably, English is the main language spoken (a prestige language) of Saint Lucia, however, Saint Lucian Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/ Patois/ Patwa is only regarded as a heritage language of the island. Gathering quantifiable data on linguistics here could mean the difference between classifying the Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language (ACF) as active or endangered, and low-resource versus underresourced. To effectively allocate the necessary resources towards the examination and preservation of languages like Kwéyòl, it may be beneficial to monitor and establish quantifiable data on the actual status of language diversity and vitality on the island. 

The importance of language diversity and vitality in society was recently highlighted in the observance of the 2021 International Mother Language Day. The theme for this annual UNESCO celebration (typically held on February 21st) was 'Fostering Multilingualism for Inclusion in Education And Society' {% cite joseph_2021 %}. It focused on the significance of an 'individual’s first language, indigenous language, native language emphasizing that instruction of such languages should begin in the early years". This theme was said to be the impetus for further development of the Saint Lucian Nation Language Policy, and can also support efforts to monitor, preserve, and examine this language {% cite joseph_2021 %}. 

Therefore, I am currently attempting to utilize surveys and data science tools to investigate and establish foundational truths about the linguistic environment in Saint Lucia, with particular attention to the vitality status of the local heritage language of Saint Lucian Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/ Patois/ Patwa). These surveys will be executed with close consideration of the articles present in the 'Charter on Language Policy and Language Rights in the Creole-Speaking Caribbean' {% cite icclr_2011 harris_2011 pousada2011linguists %}. Conducting a series of surveys will not only aid my educational pursuits but will also serve to bolster the execution of the upcoming Saint Lucian national language policy {% cite camdu_st_lucia_national_2021 camdu_2018 edu_ministry_2017 satney_2021 harris_2011 mini_edu_2021 joseph_2021 %}. 

Notably, in 2006, Simmons-McDonald's suggested that a top-down policy from the government would 'not be appropriate in introducing a shift in policy as this would only serve to build resistance to Kweyol for the same reasons that it was stigmatized in the first place' {% cite simmons2006cultural %}. Ultimately, I disagree with this recommendation. A more nuanced approach to using the government to reduce the stigmas associated with the language would be to carefully introduce and encourage the use of the language as part of the job descriptions and duties of key governmental positions or other crucial jobs in society. 

This undertaking will finally enact Carrington's wishes for the creation of quantifiable data on the current status of the language {% cite Carrington1999 %}, by investigating its usage among some of the most crucial members of Saint Lucia's labor force. The work of teachers, medical workers, lawyers, and law enforcement, are valuable to this study as they are respected pillars of society whose tasks typically require frequent interaction with the Saint Lucian public. These are all respectable jobs in society that do operate with varying degrees of governmental influence and regulation. 

It is hoped that this quantifiable data will aid in allocating teaching and learning language resources to these crucial members of society; perhaps the subsequent association of Kwéyòl with these respected professions will boost its recognition and prestige {% cite hutchinson_1998 %}. I am inclined to believe that connecting Kwéyòl with elite members of society may be yet another necessary step towards recognizing it as an official language of Saint Lucia. 


### Introduction to Surveys

While employing various data science techniques to analyze the current vitality of a low-resource language may provide useful information, on its own, this application of data science would provide an incomplete perspective of a language that arose from purely oral communication. Linguistic surveys may be the best way to assess the vitality of a low-resource language. I have attempted to utilize surveys to establish foundational truths about the current vitality status of the Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language.  

In an attempt to bolster the execution of the current Saint Lucian national language policy, I hope to conduct a series of language surveys, with particular attention to the vitality of the Kwéyòl language. This undertaking seeks to create quantifiable data on the current status of the language highlighting the details of crucial Saint Lucian labor force members. Due to the increasingly multilingual landscape, effective communication on the island increasingly may involve applying various language skills to meet each situation. The work of teachers, medical workers (in the realms of both physical and mental health), lawyers, and law enforcement, are valuable to this study as their work typically encompasses frequent human interaction.

These surveys are essential to supporting the updated Saint Lucian National Language Policy. Without quantifiable base metrics, it may be challenging to monitor and gauge the amelioration of the current language conditions. For example, it would be problematic to establish facts about the improvement of nationwide Kwéyòl literacy without ever exploring the existing capabilities of the public. Moreover, without the data collected from these surveys, it would be difficult to efficiently allocate the necesary resources towards national language services. For example, one would be unable to definitively confirm if and which communities are more Kwéyòl literate than others, and how the skills of those communities can be effectively leveraged to aid the weaker ones.

Additionally, these language surveys seek to provide information not available in previous language surveys. Most of the past ones appear to request information on how the community 'feels' about the current situation and also inquired into the public's opinions and suggestions for improvement and resource allocation strategies. However, these surveys will attempt to focus on the actual experiences based on their exposure to various languages and to quantify the linguistic capabilities of the public. 

The distribution of surveys has begun. The Bar Association of Saint Lucia assisted in the distribution of one language survey to its lawyers; it aimed to explore lawyers' multilingual capabilities and the language resources available to their clients. Another survey is underway with the Saint Lucian Ministry of Education. This survey aimed at conducting a teacher survey to gauge the role that multilingualism plays in their interactions with students. The few more surveys may be attempted before the end of my dissertation period.

As of 2003-2017, the Central Statistical Office of Saint Lucia tourists' data (tourists' arrival by country of residence) revealed much about the possible language diversity of incoming tourists. Most came from U.S.A, Canada, Europe (United Kingdom, Germany, France, Rest of Europe), Caribbean, and Rest of World; it should be noted that the format of the data changed as of 2018, and so Germany is now classified as part of the DACH Region (The DACH region in Europe comprises the countries Austria, Germany, and Switzerland). Therefore, tourists data is now displayed as U.S.A, U.K, Caribbean, Canada, DACH Region, France, Rest of Europe, Rest of World. 

Moreover, statistics about the Saint Lucia Citizenship by Investment Program (CIP) from 2016 until 2020, can reveal information on nationality distribution of new citizens, and therefore provide insight into the evolving language diversity in Saint Lucia . Nationalities of new citizens and new applicants include China, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Lebanon, Indonesia, Iraq, Iran,  Syria, Russia, Egypt, and Turkey. Most of these are Arabic-speaking countries, although the overwhelming majority of new citizens are indeed from China.

Based on the data for the nationality distribution of new citizens due to the Citizenship by Investment Program, 'Mandarin Chinese (or any Sino-Tibetan language not mentioned)' encompasses the growing number of nationals from China, and  'Arabic (or any Semitic language not mentioned)' encompasses persons from Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, etc. 'Hindi (or any Indo-Iranian/ Dravidian language not mentioned)' encompasses the languages present in the Caribbean due to indentured labor (including Tamil), yet it also encompasses the languages of new citizens from countries such as Pakistan. 'Turkish (or any Turkic/ Altaic language not mentioned)' accounts for the rapidly growing number of citizens from Turkey. According to the CIP data, the South Korean and Indonesian national numbers are also increasing, but not as quickly as the Turkish population; therefore, it does appear necessary to include the language groupings that encompass foreign languages are provably now part of Saint Lucian society. These languages would be represented via 'Korean' and 'Indonesian (or any Austronesian/ Austroasiatic/ Kra-Dai language not mentioned)' respectively.
