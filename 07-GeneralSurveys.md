### Introduction to Surveys

While employing various data science techniques to analyze the current vitality of a low-resource language may provide useful information, on its own, this application of data science would provide an incomplete perspective of a language that arose from purely oral communication. Linguistic surveys may be the best way to assess the vitality of a low-resource language. I have attempted to utilize surveys to establish foundational truths about the current vitality status of the Saint Lucian Kwéyòl language.  

In an attempt to bolster the execution of the current Saint Lucian national language policy, I hope to conduct a series of language surveys, with particular attention to the vitality of the Kwéyòl language. This undertaking seeks to create quantifiable data on the current status of the language highlighting the details of crucial Saint Lucian labor force members. Due to the increasingly multilingual landscape, effective communication on the island increasingly may involve applying various language skills to meet each situation. The work of teachers, medical workers (in the realms of both physical and mental health), lawyers, and law enforcement, are valuable to this study as their work typically encompasses frequent human interaction.

These surveys are essential to supporting the updated Saint Lucian National Language Policy. Without quantifiable base metrics, it may be challenging to monitor and gauge the amelioration of the current language conditions. For example, it would be problematic to establish facts about the improvement of nationwide Kwéyòl literacy without ever exploring the existing capabilities of the public. Moreover, without the data collected from these surveys, it would be difficult to efficiently allocate the necesary resources towards national language services. For example, one would be unable to definitively confirm if and which communities are more Kwéyòl literate than others, and how the skills of those communities can be effectively leveraged to aid the weaker ones.

Additionally, these language surveys seek to provide information not available in previous language surveys. Most of the past ones appear to request information on how the community 'feels' about the current situation and also inquired into the public's opinions and suggestions for improvement and resource allocation strategies. However, these surveys will attempt to focus on the actual experiences based on their exposure to various languages and to quantify the linguistic capabilities of the public. 

The distribution of surveys has begun. The Bar Association of Saint Lucia assisted in the distribution of one language survey to its lawyers; it aimed to explore lawyers' multilingual capabilities and the language resources available to their clients. Another survey is underway with the Saint Lucian Ministry of Education. This survey aimed at conducting a teacher survey to gauge the role that multilingualism plays in their interactions with students. The few more surveys may be attempted before the end of my dissertation period.

As of 2003-2017, the Central Statistical Office of Saint Lucia tourists' data (tourists' arrival by country of residence) revealed much about the possible language diversity of incoming tourists. Most came from U.S.A, Canada, Europe (United Kingdom, Germany, France, Rest of Europe), Caribbean, and Rest of World; it should be noted that the format of the data changed as of 2018, and so Germany is now classified as part of the DACH Region (The DACH region in Europe comprises the countries Austria, Germany, and Switzerland). Therefore, tourists data is now displayed as U.S.A, U.K, Caribbean, Canada, DACH Region, France, Rest of Europe, Rest of World. 

Moreover, statistics about the Saint Lucia Citizenship by Investment Program (CIP) from 2016 until 2020, can reveal information on nationality distribution of new citizens, and therefore provide insight into the evolving language diversity in Saint Lucia . Nationalities of new citizens and new applicants include China, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Lebanon, Indonesia, Iraq, Iran,  Syria, Russia, Egypt, and Turkey. Most of these are Arabic-speaking countries, although the overwhelming majority of new citizens are indeed from China.

Based on the data for the nationality distribution of new citizens due to the Citizenship by Investment Program, 'Mandarin Chinese (or any Sino-Tibetan language not mentioned)' encompasses the growing number of nationals from China, and  'Arabic (or any Semitic language not mentioned)' encompasses persons from Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, etc. 'Hindi (or any Indo-Iranian/ Dravidian language not mentioned)' encompasses the languages present in the Caribbean due to indentured labor (including Tamil), yet it also encompasses the languages of new citizens from countries such as Pakistan. 'Turkish (or any Turkic/ Altaic language not mentioned)' accounts for the rapidly growing number of citizens from Turkey. According to the CIP data, the South Korean and Indonesian national numbers are also increasing, but not as quickly as the Turkish population; therefore, it does appear necessary to include the language groupings that encompass foreign languages are provably now part of Saint Lucian society. These languages would be represented via 'Korean' and 'Indonesian (or any Austronesian/ Austroasiatic/ Kra-Dai language not mentioned)' respectively.
