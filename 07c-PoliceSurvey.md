### Introduction:

Royal Saint Lucia Police Force (RSLPF) has to navigate law enforcement tasks in an ever-increasing multilingual jurisdiction. The justice system relies on how effectively the police force can gather crucial details related to statements and evidence; officers also need to be able to keep civilians safe by effectively communicating with them during emergencies. However, the status of the multilingual capacities of the RSLPF is unknown; there are even particular concerns about the force's ability to communicate in the local heritage language of Saint Lucian Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/ Patois/ Patwa). Introducing the analysis of such data would not only provide valuable information to the RSLP and the public but would also reinforce the importance of data science tools and the need for further investigation of natural language processing (including computational linguistics) in such an environment. This survey will focus on the crucial providers of law enforcement in Saint Lucia. 


### Literature Review (brief):

The 2021 publication of Dr. Sandra Evans in Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages, Ou ni right-la pou remain silans’ The case for a standard Kwéyòl translation of the pre-trial right to silence', supports the academic merit of conducting surveys on language and law enforcement in Saint Lucia. That work focused on linguistics and the justice system in Saint Lucia, and the potential for miscarriages of justice due to lack of communication of civilian rights in Kwéyòl. While it is important that officers communicate key phrases in the heritage language of Saint Lucia, it appears that the study may have overlooked gaining a base assessment of the overall multilingual capabilities of the force, and the extent of their Kwéyòl's vitality in officer-civilian interactions.
