### Introduction:

Royal Saint Lucia Police Force (RSLPF) has to navigate law enforcement tasks in an ever-increasing multilingual jurisdiction. The justice system relies on how effectively the police force can gather crucial details related to statements and evidence; officers also need to be able to keep civilians safe by effectively communicating with them during emergencies. However, the status of the multilingual capacities of the RSLPF is unknown; there are even particular concerns about the force's ability to communicate in the local heritage language of Saint Lucian Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/ Patois/ Patwa). Introducing the analysis of such data would not only provide valuable information to the RSLP and the public but would also reinforce the importance of data science tools and the need for further investigation of natural language processing (including computational linguistics) in such an environment. This survey will focus on the crucial providers of law enforcement in Saint Lucia. 


### Literature Review (brief):

The 2021 publication of Dr. Sandra Evans in Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages, Ou ni right-la pou remain silans’ The case for a standard Kwéyòl translation of the pre-trial right to silence', supports the academic merit of conducting surveys on language and law enforcement in Saint Lucia. That work focused on linguistics and the justice system in Saint Lucia, and the potential for miscarriages of justice due to lack of communication of civilian rights in Kwéyòl. While it is important that officers communicate key phrases in the heritage language of Saint Lucia, it appears that the study may have overlooked gaining a base assessment of the overall multilingual capabilities of the force, and the extent of their Kwéyòl's vitality in officer-civilian interactions. 

Therefore, I am currently attempting to utilize surveys and data science tools to investigate and establish foundational truths about the linguistic environment in Saint Lucia, with particular attention to the vitality status of the local heritage language of Saint Lucian Kwéyòl (Antillean Creole/ Patois/ Patwa). These surveys will be executed with close consideration of the articles present in the 'Charter on Language Policy and Language Rights in the Creole-Speaking Caribbean' {% cite icclr_2011 harris_2011 pousada2011linguists %}. Conducting a series of surveys will not only aid my educational pursuits but will also serve to bolster the execution of the upcoming Saint Lucian national language policy {% cite camdu_st_lucia_national_2021 camdu_2018 edu_ministry_2017 satney_2021 harris_2011 mini_edu_2021 joseph_2021 %}. This survey will focus on the crucial providers of education in Saint Lucia.
